Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\'s pad\nSingin\' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, ""Hey Fab, I\'ma kill you!""\nLyrics comin\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\' I\'m a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I\'m superhuman\nInnovative and I\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\' off of me and it\'ll glue to you and\nI\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin\' audience a feeling like it\'s levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they\'ll be celebrating\n\'Cause I know the way to get \'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n""Oh, he\'s too mainstream.""\nWell, that\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n""It\'s not hip-hop, it\'s pop,""—\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on ""Lose Yourself"" and make \'em lose it\n""I don\'t know how to make songs like that\nI don\'t know what words to use.""\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I\'m rippin\' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt\'s curtains, I\'m inadvertently hurtin\' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself \'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I\'m a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI\'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""\nBut in my head there\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here\'s what they want from me\nThey\'re askin\' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life\'s handin\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can\'t batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake \'em a cake then?\nDon\'t mistake him for Satan\nIt\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed', '1506 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsPolskiItalianoFrançaisNederlands中文Killshot Lyrics\nYou sound like a bitch, bitch\nShut the fuck up\nWhen your fans become your haters\nYou done?\nFuckin\' beard\'s weird\nAlright\nYou yellin\' at the mic, fuckin\' weird beard (You want smoke)\nWe doin\' this once\nYou yellin\' at the mic, your beard\'s weird\nWhy you yell at the mic?

I\'m perplexed\nInsult me in a line, compliment me on the next\nDamn, I\'m really sorry you want me to have a heart attack\nWas watchin\' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack\nRealized I forgot to call you back\nHere\'s that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nStan, Stan, son\nListen, man, Dad isn\'t mad\nBut how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun\nAnd have a man-bun?\nThe giant\'s woke, eyes open, undeniable\nSupplyin\' smoke, got the fire stoked\nSay you got me in a scope, but you grazed me\nI say one call to Interscope and you\'re Swayze\nYour reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""\nSo before you die let\'s see who can out-petty who\nWith your corny lines (""Slim, you\'re old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh\nBut I\'m 45 and I\'m still outselling you\nBy 29, I had three albums that had blew\nNow let\'s talk about somethin\' I don\'t really do\nGo in someone\'s daughter\'s mouth stealin\' food\nBut you\'re a fuckin\' mole hill\nNow I\'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!\nHo, chill, actin\' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow\nGunner? Bitch, you ain\'t a bow and arrow\nSay you\'ll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin\' lead (Brrt)\nPlayin\' dead, that\'s the only time you hold still (Hold up)\nAre you eating cereal or oatmeal?\nWhat the fuck\'s in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?\n\'Cause I\'m takin\' a shit in \'em, Kelly, I need reading material\n…Dictionary…\n""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked\nGo back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago\nWhat do you know? Oops\nKnow your facts before you come at me, lil\' goof\nLuxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in \'02\nTo burn it in front of you, ho\nYounger me? No, you the wack me, it\'s funny but so true\nI\'d rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you\n\'Til I\'m hitting old age\nStill can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old\'s rage\nGot more fans than you in your own city, lil\' kiddy, go play\nFeel like I\'m babysitting Lil Tay\nGot the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day\nShootin\' a video just to fuckin\' dig your own grave\nGot you at your own wake, I\'m the billy goat\nYou ain\'t never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay\nNext to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow\nKelly, they\'ll be putting your name\nNext to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!\nLike the last motherfucker sayin\' Hailie in vain\nAlien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)\nMy biggest flops are your greatest hits\nThe game\'s mine again and ain\'t nothin\' changed but the locks\nSo before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss\nGotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)\nBein\' rich-shamed by some prick usin\' my name for clickbait\nIn a state of bliss \'cause I said his goddamn name\nNow I gotta cock back, aim\nYeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)\nIt\'s your moment\nThis is it, as big as you\'re gonna get, so enjoy it\nHad to give you a career to destroy it\nLethal injection\nGo to sleep six feet deep, I\'ll give you a B for the effort\nBut if I was three-foot-eleven\nYou\'d look up to me, and for the record\nYou would suck a dick to fuckin\' be me for a second\nLick a ballsack to get on my channel\nGive your life to be as solidified\nThis mothafuckin\' shit is like Rambo when he\'s out of bullets\nSo what good is a fuckin\' machine gun when it\'s outta ammo?\nHad enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper\nHow the fuck can him and I battle?\nHe\'ll have to fuck Kim in my flannel\nI\'ll give him my sandals\n\'Cause he knows, long as I\'m Shady he\'s gon\' have to live in my shadow\nExhausting, letting off on my offspring\nLick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!\nYou dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see\nYou\'re fuckin\' salty\n\'Cause Young Gerald\'s balls-deep inside of Halsey\nYour red sweater, your black leather\nYou dress better, I rap better\nThat a death threat or a love letter?\nLittle white toothpick\nThinks it\'s over a pic, I just don\'t like you, prick\nThanks for dissing me\nNow I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""\nBut really I don\'t care who\'s in the right\nBut you\'re losin\' the fight you picked\nWho else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L\'s!\nFuckin\' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle\nKillshot, I will not fail, I\'m with the Doc still\nBut this idiot\'s boss pops pills and tells him he\'s got skills\nBut, Kells, the day you put out a hit\'s the day Diddy admits\nThat he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!\nI\'m sick of you bein\' wack\nAnd still usin\' that mothafuckin\' Auto-Tune\nSo let\'s talk about it (Let\'s talk about it)\nI\'m sick of your mumble rap mouth\nNeed to get the cock up out it\nBefore we can even talk about it (Talk about it)\nI\'m sick of your blonde hair and earrings\nJust \'cause you look in the mirror and think\nThat you\'re Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)\nDon\'t mean you are, and you\'re not about it\nSo just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it\nYou might also like\nYou fuckin\'—oh\nAnd I\'m just playin\', Diddy\nYou know I love you1.8KEmbed']"
