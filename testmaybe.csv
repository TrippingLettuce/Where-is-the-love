You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they cant touch this I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this Thats the sound of

Get me on the court and Im trouble Last week fucked around and got a triple double Freakin niggas every way like MJ I cant believe today was a good day Drove to the pad and hit the showers Didnt even get no static from the cowards Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me Saw the police and they rolled right past me No flexin didnt even look in a niggas direction As I ran the intersection Went to Short Dogs house they was watchin Yo MTV Raps Whats the haps on the craps Shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em Roll em in a circle of niggas And watch me break em with the 7 711 711 7 even back door Little Joe I picked up the cash flow Then we played bones and Im yellin Domino Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA Today was a good day  Left my niggas house paid Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani And my dick runs deep so deep So deep put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun Drove her to the pad and Im coastin Took another sip of the potion hit the threewheel motion I was glad everything had worked out Dropped her ass off and then chirped out Today was like one of those fly dreams Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams No helicopter lookin for a murder Two in the morning got the Fatburger Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp And it read Ice Cubes a Pimp Yeah Drunk as hell but no throwin up Halfway home and my pager still blowin up Today I didnt even have to use my AK I gotta say it was a good day See Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like Hey wait wait a minute Pooh stop this shit What the fuck am I
