boy cause— Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton—no Asgard Asgard  So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloadin Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin But I got your mom deepthroatin Im out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin in common poodle Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin To censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows You write normal Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad Singin to a man while he played piano Man oh man that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed J.J. Fad Uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and Im devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream. Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hiphop its pop—cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too Ugh school flunky pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Ima sleep in the front seat Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake em a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard—be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a god6.7KEmbed 1286
