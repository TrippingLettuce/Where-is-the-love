عربيةDear Mama Lyrics You are appreciated  When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies the same drama When things went wrong wed blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And whod think in elementary hey Id see the penitentiary one day And runnin from the police thats right Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside And even as a crack fiend Mama You always was a black queen Mama I finally understand For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it Theres no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated You might also like Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya  Now aint nobody tell us it was fair No love for my daddy cause the coward wasnt there He passed away and I didnt cry Cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me You never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hotplate You just workin with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin But now the road got rough youre alone Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own And theres no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya  Pour out some liquor and I reminisce Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that Im hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on Its a struggle every day gotta roll on And theres no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya

surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words wont come out Hes choking how Everybodys

whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its Back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody

Demons fightin you its dark Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you I dont think you realize what you mean to me Not the slightest clue Cause me and you were like a crew I was like

my way on my way on my way down On my way on my way on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun know you know I find my way back round They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now I aint gon sit around and front like I aint thought about it A perfect smile is more appealing but its funny how My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it I keep my twisted grill just to show the kids its real We aint picture perfect but we worth the picture still I got smart I got rich and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows thick as hell Love yourself girl or nobody will Though you a woman I dont know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you killin yourself to find a man thatll kill for you You wake up put makeup on Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on Your roommate yelling Why you gotta take so long What its like to have a crooked smile You might also like Even though I— On my way on my way on my way down On my way on my way on my way down This crooked smile You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun know you know I find my way back round Yeah  To all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling You wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling You keep falling victim ‘cause youre insecure And when I tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure ‘Cause he dont seem to want you back and its got you askin So all you see is what you lackin not what you packin Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl you a star dont let em tell you youre not Now is it real Eyebrows fingernails hair Is it real If its not girl you dont care ‘Cause whats real is somethin that the eyes cant see That the hands can’t touch that them broads can’t be And that’s you never let em see your frown And if you need a friend to pick you up I’ll be around And we can ride with the windows down the music loud I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile Even though I— On my way on my way on my way down On my way on my way on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun know you know I find my way back round  We got the crooked smile we can style on em Back round crooked smile we can style on em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun know you know I find my way back round We dont look nothin like the people on the screen You know the movie stars picture perfect beauty queens But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em Look at the nation That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail Wonder why we inhale ‘cause we in Hell already I ask If my skin pale would I then sell like Eminem or Adele But one more time for the Ville And fuck all of that beef shit nigga let’s make a mil Hey officer man we don’t want nobody gettin killed Just open up that cell let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now and well now If you askin will I tell now—ayy hell nah I ain’t snitchin cause man they get them niggas stitches now If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now How you like this crooked smile Even though I— On my way on my way on my way down On my way on my way

you She lie through her teeth; cavities fillings She know where you hide it tell me where its hidden She know when you gone tell me when to visit We break in your home and take the specifics And meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him So she dont get blamed we dont snatch chains We find out addresses and we dont leave messes Youll only know that its gone when you checking Then your first

Whats up Been a minute since we kicked it youve been caught up With them bitches I dont get it youre a star love You shouldnt have to deal with that Id never make you feel like that Cause  I love me I

love  Yeah I needed to hear that shit I hate when youre submissive Passive aggressive when were texting I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation And influence a generation thats lacking in patience Ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics Weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grownups You a flower child beautiful child Im in your zone Looking like you came from the seventies on your own My mother is sixtysix and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone You dont even know what you want from love anymore I search for something Im missing and disappear

flexing Ill never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how Ill never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong That was just negative energy for me to feed off Now its therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macys where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree Ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how Im living I just hope Im forgiven It seem like you dont want this love anymore Im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore But girl what qualities was I looking for before Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy huh I love me I love me enough for the both of us Thats why you

the night like the 4th of July Niggas know when I let go niggas die With this Y and you dont know you slow Like Baltimore if you aint tryin to go you blow I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence When I let go its violence cause the wildest Is the dog barkin up the tree for the cat In the fog what yall niggas see is the bat Flappin away but Im blind like Stevie Niggas dont hear me

pain youre in a world of hurt So Jump around Jump Jump Get that ass shaking Jump around Jump Came to hit you with a fan favorite But if you too fly for coach better get them arms And freaking hands flailing and Jump Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind More afraid of success than I am of failure So what does that tell ya That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail Before he ran straight into the damn railing Yo chill man—chill 255Embed 55 Contributors#TwerkIt Lyrics Yo yuh dun know Dis time when we come in we come fi flatline

Cee Cipher Power stalk plus the fiend talk 3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court White lies and blackmail land me back in jail Were all for sale a stolen goal but it fail Stranded on the front line I shine

To have to take things to deadly measures And have you measured and shot for no pay Its assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives And lures MCs to the lair With a miclike bait then awaits to be bitten by greed Temptation tempts my victim to proceed Forward ignorance wouldnt allow retreat Youd rather pursue death than admit defeat Now whos best to describe for what I specialize in Murderous rhyming constantly inclining My mind spits with an enormous kickback Your brain then absorbs the impact Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

game Told me if you tryin to make your move you gotta know your lane homie All you got your name and your word so never break it For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where Im from Aint no conversation all they understand is get a gun I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street Way back in the day before I had all of this paper Before I had all of these diamonds before I had all of these haters  Now I remember when I seen it and to me it was stuntin I remember when I bought it I aint need it or nothing Always in a different state so now they label me a goner I aint come up out of nowhere Im from straight up off the corner Now everywhere we go they probably know my name cause I been there Now everywhere we go they said how much I spend when Im in there And Im throwing up my money for the ones who never made it Sayin fuck the ones who hated roll one up and celebrate See Wiz Khalifa LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like Now lets get medicated Man lets get medicated Lets get medicated Man Im hella faded Man

is peace Always on the grind thats every day so police looking Im just rapping killing beats and tryin to stay away from booking Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home  Now I remember when I seen it and to me it was stuntin I remember when I bought it I aint need it or nothing Always in a different state so now they label me

Rich Homie Quan Type Of WayOne hit wonder or talented hit maker That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way. The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet  even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem54.

Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bapesque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights” Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free49.

Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY 42.

Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Coles album Born Sinner. While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses talking about religion his inner struggle and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft.

Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh and there’s THAT VIDEO The talkrap slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout and then he made that video and this became undeniably nextlevel. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave Oakland”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album this is a dark entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work Remix” ft. A$AP Rocky French Montana SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s singsongy cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to some jumping around is mandatory. But listen closely and you get Chancelor’s dope bars dense greatsounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On Were Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same standout combines Drizzy’s loud arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty bassheavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song  he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris standout track “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark Odd Future feel Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl Thats up for debate but you cant deny that Shyne and everyone else on the song absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed Love Game was one of the most heavilyanticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegadelevel backandforth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as leftfield as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubinproduced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s cheesy sample included Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”“Started From The Bottom” produced by Mike Zombie was the first single off Drakes Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’ but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you you can be completely alone in a crowded room to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hiphop converge on this mixtape cut with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and reintroducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and singsongy verse; Twista on the other hand is not quite so willing to take a back seat successfuly lacing the track with his trademark doubletime bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hiphop is once again Chicagoan.14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world Jay Zs boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 119 of his new albums leadoff track is not Hov but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation so that we are wellprimed for the rappers entry.And what an entry it is. His daughters name is literally the first word out of his mouth and with good reason. A postfatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame while admitting ultimately that he cant leave it alone. And lest we think hes lost a step his patented wordplay is in full effect with a pun on pigeons that puts todays cokerappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar Joey Badass Yelawolf Danny Brown Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.1 Train is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a lineup without a single weak spitter and they all did their worst to this HitBoy produced banger. Its impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here was it the energized Danny Brown the lovable braggart Action Bronson the wordsmith Joey Bad the harddriving Big K.R.I.T. Someone else I cant decide but I do know this the track is flames12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainments main artists Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things and how other people cant have them before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album it was fair to assume it would result in a genreblending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song which represents the rebellious IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop Kanye crafts an uneasy raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl but also hiphop and its impact on him  giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013 fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back” and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West  Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future Who really cares Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like Well many would actually say “the video” which was an overtly cheesy greenscreened steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to muchloved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a followup to his epic 2000 storysong “Stan” fans were nervous.  After all Stan died at the end right So what’s leftPlenty as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew with the autographed Starter cap now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex the song switches perspective revealing an intense look at Eminem’s selfdoubts and anguish. Just before the end he drops the biggest gem of all his insong tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know but trust us Slim we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing Kendrick is in the midst of consumption  the contrast is phenomenal both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night 4 shots of espresso every morning and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure prealbum release but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song like Kanye originally planned The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God””Six minutes Slim Shady you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapidfire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP sneak disses to some of his old buddies and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day Rap God was released and has now amassed over 4 million page views Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say Rap God proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a babys first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons well skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion while sneaking in TV and car references and even mentioning his late grandmother much like Sean did.However there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pacs offspring and the King of New York causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MCs of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper  by their name a rarity in Hip Hop no sneak disses here. Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank OceanNew Slaves is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people  made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry and even Americas prison system it’s hard to disagree The Chitown native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically  would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first His movement spearheaded with this peoples anthem was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the MatrixJust as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West578Embed 134 ContributorsCinderella Lyrics  Uh $ign Oh no no no no no no no no no No no $ign Ayy  I been waitin all

five .9s When you was pretendin to be the white Royce da 59 I just crossed a fine line Might just force the white guy to call D12 so he can be the pork they grind swine And the biggest rapper in Detroit that award is Sean Don So uncork the Chardonnay and stick my fork in white wine I never heard you in a club I never heard you in a bar Eleven albums and ten never got played inside of my car Id rather listen to Snitch9ine like sixtynine times And participate in sixtynines with sixtynine nuns than listen to you Youre a Karen call the cops tell em its a Black man on your block With a Glock

riddle me this You love your mother Well Im cleanin out your closet for you and your halfbrother And I told you when I was in Detroit I wanna go to 8 Mile Cause when I was little to get some M&Ms I

games all endin The chainsaw vrin vrin Hello Hello Pagin Dr. Dre He aint got a lot to say But since Curtis always do let him write the rhymes for you Tell him to clip the wings on my butterfly tatt and force em back in the cocoon Now does he still rap or did he have a change of heart too The chick on the show wasnt pickin me and Mariah wasnt pickin you So the cannons is blamblammin and if it jam then I unjam it And wipe down my stripper pole with the hair grease from your bandana You wish you was Santana or Cam in them 10 Js Durag for ten years and never had one wave And I was that runaway slave that they buried in that one grave And some say he would back to haunt Slim Shady one day Now Im here hope you ready this is not moms spaghetti This your dad was twentytwo when he ate lil Debbie

dead now its just you and me The sweatpants the dad hat durag and no jewelry Umm is that cultural appropriation Ask Paul if its even appropriate for me to make that statement rude of me How your day went Did you redye your beard or get another face lift or do shrooms in your moms basement Until you nod and see spaceships And the aliens inside it come and tell you your talents wasted Then you wake up and you aint shit I know you fiendin for a Dr. Dre bass hit How ironic an addict in a basement And now I chronic cause I done had it with the fake shit You never understood ebonics or a cadence I press everything like a weight bench And every time the plate hits you off another playlist Sorry it aint workin out Niggas shootin Billy Blanks Its my winners speech While Im here I should really thank MGK UGK Tech N9ne Uzi spray My other twelve personalities wasnt really in the mood today Hi kids heres somethin funny lets all say Nigga once Crashed the car hit and run Jumped out hid the gun

Stephanie Mills left any extra refills Of ecstasy pills next to me in the seats spilled Or she eat em all with a breakfast drink You inspect the sink Im in the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin I dabble in Vics But I might just swallow my fuckin Ritalin tablet after tonight Im grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet Cause thats what its like and attackin it like a Dracula bite Jetpack in a backpack when I write All this anger pentup inside I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter Figured Id try to set a big enough fire Thatll trigger the sprinkler system And Id escape but the getaway driver Screwed up my limo collided with the center divider I went through the window And ended up being pinned to the side Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guys wife Brenda The flight attendant from Idaho That took an antenna in the vagina hole Cause when I pick up a pen Im venomous And Im as slick as Dennis the Menace Like an evil dental hygienist sinister Youve been yellin dementedness I invented this Im the genesis Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist Fuckin smart alec degenerate I got Ellen DeGeneres Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy envious Of female

ContributorsI’m Sorry Lyrics Go ahead and call me a coward Say that Im not strong because Im not like you Go ahead and call me crazy Cause I live in a maze tell me how about you I think I live in my head Sometimes I think that Im dead I hide behind my youth Know I been losing my mind And Im a little behind step inside my shoes Cause Ive never been happy with myself And I dont need no one feeling bad for me Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me Behind closed doors just close the door Let me be by myself—just me and myself Im tired of living I cry I hear its easy to die I wanna see for myself And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else But Im depressed as fuck stressed as fuck Aint no medicine that could cure whats the test as drugs I mean I need extra love And that aint even enough said that aint even enough And where the fuck is God God God Damn maybe I aint believing enough But today we gonna see if hes real And if He is then I guess Im prolly going to hell Look I aint wanna die like this I aint picture my life like this They dont know what its like like this Pretending Im happy so I can smile like this and laugh like you Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like Woo Or would you feel lost without me Cause honestly I think the world is better off without me And my minds spinning this is the line finish Truth is I dont care how they feel about my feelings I made up my mind Im going out like Robin Williams I guess Im not the Ordinary People of John Legend And Ive been suicidal since the day I was nine shit Okay the day I was nine Ive been tired of being bullied couldnt stay out the fire Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time And dammit look at me now fuck Fuck pen runnin out shit fu— ugh Look just know its a new day But if you reading this then its prolly too late blaow You might also like Just make sure you tell my family its okay Im sorry But its too late Im sorry so much weighing on me I dont wanna live to see another day Im sorry But I cant stay Im sorry so much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family its okay Im sorry But its too late Im sorry so much weighing on me I dont wanna live to see another day Im sorry But I cant stay Im sorry so much weighing on me  I hope you got what you wanted I hope you finally happy its too late for you Been going out of my mind You dont know how many times that I done prayed for you I hope you hear me goddammit Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you I used to shine now Im all in the dark I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart But goddammit look at you now its all of your fault How could you Maybe its my fault I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin Maybe I should have been more of an influence I cant believe that youre dead I fu– I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it But Ill forever be attached to you Damn Part of me feels bad for you A part of me feels like you weak and Im mad at you And I dont mean to be insensitive But I dont understand how we couldnt prevent this shit You took the easy way out goddammit you did I mean look what you did Im so fucking upset How could you be so selfish Nigga how could you be so selfish Now youre gone you done left me so helpless I wonder what God thinks I hope you in Gods place behaving yourself Yo what the fuck you gotta say for yourself Say for yourself Look I really feel lost without you I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you And my minds spinning this is the line finish Truth is I dont care how you feel about my feelings And Id be lying to you if I told you Im fine listen I know that you can hear me all I need is like five minutes I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out Im sorry this is something that we both couldnt figure out I wish I could hear you now is your soul missing I wonder if you could do it again would you do it different Tell me what death is like Was it meant for you brodie Did the heaven support it Are you fucking happy now Did you get what you wanted Isnt this what you wanted I feel the temperature falling And youve been suicidal back then you were nine Yeah even back then you was nine We was living on the edge couldnt stay out the fire Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time And damn it look at you now shit But its a new day And if you cant hear me its probably too late fuck Just make sure you tell my family its okay Im sorry But its too late Im sorry so much weighing on me I dont wanna live to see another day Im sorry But I cant stay Im sorry so much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family its okay Im sorry But its too late Im sorry so much weighing on me I dont wanna live to see another day Im sorry But I cant stay Im sorry so much weighing on me Just make sure you tell my family its okay Im sorry But its too late Im sorry so much

dont have pity for you black niggas thats the way I feel Screamin Black Lives Matter All the black guysd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills Yellin Nigga this and Nigga that Call everybody Nigga and get a nigga mad As soon as I say Nigga then everyone react And wanna swing at me and call me racist cause I aint black Well pound that then Talkin bout slavery like you was around back then Like you was pickin cotton off the fuckin ground back then Like you was on the plantation gettin down back then Aight look I see a black man aimin his gun But Id rather see a black man claimin his son And I dont mean just for one day and you done I mean You still trapped in a rut And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what So you can keep livin on free government assistance Food stamps for your children but you still tryna sell em For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin babysitter While you party on the road cause you aint got no fuckin goals You already late You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight wait Its like youre proud to be fake But you lazy as fuck And youd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate Fuck outta my face You cant escape problems You can pray for some change but cant break a dollar Got nobody else to blame so you blame Donald They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom My voice been back Im not racist my sisters boyfriends black Im not racist my sisterinlaws baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriends black My heads in the cloud Heard theres not enough jobs for all the men in your house Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out Or maybe we should send em all to the ghetto for now Im not racist and I never lie But I think theres a disconnect between your culture and mine I worship the Einsteins study the Steve Jobs But you ride 2Pacs dick like he was a fuckin god oh my God And all you care about is rappin and stuntin and bein ratchet and thats the nigga within you Music rottin your brain and slowly start to convince you Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues Blame it all on the menu blame it on those drinks Blame it on everybody except for your own race Blame it on white privileges blame it on white kids And just blame it on white citizens aim at the vice president Bunch of class clowns Niggas kneelin on the field thats a flag down How dare you try to make demands for this money You gon show us some respect you gon stand for this country nigger Im not racist Im just prepared for this type of war I heard Eminems rap at the awards whos he fightin for Yall can take that motherfucker too he aint white no more Its like you wanna be so famous Youll do anything for attention and a little payment I cant take you nowhere without people pointin fingers Pants hangin off your ass you aint got no home trainin Pull your fuckin pants up nigga Put that suit back on take that durag off Take that gold out your mouth quit the pitiful stuff And then maybe policed stop killin you fucks yo what the fuck Im not racist Its like were livin in the same building but split into two floors Im not racist But theres two sides to every story I wish that I knew yours I wish that I knew yours Im not racist I swear You might also like With all disrespect I dont really like you white motherfuckers thats just where Im at Screaming All Lives Matter is a protest to my protest what kind of shit is that And thats one war youll never win The power in the word Nigga is a different sin We shouldnt say it but we do and thats just what it is But that dont mean that you can say it just cause you got nigga friends Nigga That word was originated for you to keep us under And when we use it we know thats just how we greet each other And when you use it we know theres a double meaning under And even if I wasnt picking cotton physically That dont mean Im not affected by the history My grandmama was a slave that shit gets to me And you aint got no motherfuckin sympathy you pussy nigga Im sorry you can never feel my life Tryna have faith but I never felt alright Its hard to elevate when this countrys ran by whites Judging me by my skin color and my blackness Tryna find a job but aint nobody call me back yet Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet You crackers aint slick this is all a part of your tactics Dont talk about no motherfuckin taxes When I aint making no dough You think you know everything but you dont You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know Try to steal black culture and then make it your own woah Fuck Im exhausted I cant even drive without the cops tryna start shit Im tired of the systematic racism bullshit All you do is false shit this the shit that Im forced with And you dont know shit about my people thats what bothers you You dont know about no fried chicken or no barbecue You dont know about the twostep or no loose change You dont know about no 2 Chainz or no KoolAid you dont know And even though Barack was half as black You hated President Obama I know thats a fact You couldnt wait to get him out and put a cracker back And then you gave us Donald Trump and now its payback for that Im not racist I never lied But I know theres a disconnect between your culture and mines Yeah I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin god He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin died nigga die nigga And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and thats the cracker within you Hatred all in your brain it slowly start to convince you And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue Blame it on Puerto Rico blame it on OJ Blame it on everybody except for your own race Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens Aim at the black businesses I aint saying Im innocent but I might be any day now Treatin everybody how you want and any way how I swear North Korea bout to bomb us any day now And now Im duckin every time I hear a fuckin plane now shit You know I make a lot of sense but you just cant admit it When Eminem went against Trump that was the illest Cause even though hes white he let us know he standin with us Im not racist but I cry a lot You dont know what its like to be in a frying pot You dont know what its like to mind your business And get stopped by the cops and not know if you bout to die or not You worry bout your life so you take mine I love you but I fuckin hate you at the same time I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives So we could understand each other more but thatd take time Im not racist Its like we livin in the same building but split into both sides Im not racist But theres two sides to every story and now you know mine Cant erase the scars with a bandage Im hopin maybe we can come to an understandin Agree to disagree we could have an understandin Im not racist170Embed 216 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیDeutschDevil’s Work Lyrics Father forgive me  Im staring at this Bible as I keep glancing Dear Lord I got questions and I need answers Tryna understand your vision all I see is damage Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing We supposed to be your children I thought we family Youre supposed to be my Father bruh I need answers We dont need to die young we just need chances Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis Bow our heads say a prayer now the seeds planted Everywhere I turn Im seeing MCs vanish Lot of good niggas gone I dont understand it Lot of families lost and they sea stranded I aint tryna disrespect you I just need answers I know youre watching us from heaven thinking Who to save Cherry pickin who should go next and who should stay Id be on my way to heaven if I knew the way And bring back every good nigga you choose to take They say you never wrong but you done made a few mistakes Cause you taking the wrong niggas maybe you should trade Trade us back all the real ones remove the fakes I think you should trade Give us 2Pac back and take that nigga Suge Ooh Let the legend resurrect and he gon live for good Ooh I been screaming Thug life in every different hood Thug life thug life If only you could bring him back Lord I wish you would Give us Biggie give us Pun give us Triple X Take that nigga Trump with you thats a bigger threat Theres too much power for a coward with no intellect Thats a bigot with a collar theres a disconnect Niggas dying Mama crying Grandma need a tissue Niggas shootin up a church now I need a pistol All them niggas still livin you dont see the issue But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you I aint tryna disrespect just need to meet up with you Lord I aint tryna overstep just want to reason with you Lord Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you Lord Send

Kelly R.I.P. Lil Snupe give that boy his life back Take Eric Holder give us Eric Wright back Im sending you this message Lord I hope you hit me right back They say Im on the wrong train I know Im on the right track Yeah Cause Trayvon gone and all he did was try to fight back Zimmerman walk around free we dont like that We dont like that Why you take our mothers from us Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us Damn you took a true king a true brother from us This a fuckin marathon but they runnin from us Now everybody got guns niggas up to something And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something You know its not fair tell the truth Ive been in my feelings too But if you took Emmett Till at least take Dylann Roof At least take James Holmes I aint even mad at that Just bring back Whitney and give us Michael Jackson back Feds want me in the slammer damn Aint no justice for Sandra Bland we up like the ceiling fan Lord if you listenin Im just lookin for a hand to hand Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again Drownin in my tears tryna pray for something Woo Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us Woo Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us Woo Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us Yeah Maybe Im just probably tripping cause I need a hug I need a hug The hood cant find jobs now we need a plug We need a plug Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug I dont go to church cause Im afraid of being judged Ive been starin at the ceiling as I lie in bed Watchin niggas follow trends like Simon Says Yeah I pray you give us back the real ones and try again Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive Laura Ingraham laughin at death and disrespectin I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention Cost too much to pay attention then it got expensive Father forgive me for I know not what I do And now Im reachin out to you hopin you hear me and return the message Joyner I know that you got our back and that youre not against us Or maybe you just love us so you doin shit to test us I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us They say that the good die young and I aint on the guest list Ive been drinkin Lord forgive me its my blood racin I dont know what Im thinking Im just frustrated I

ContributorsRoss Capicchioni Lyrics Woke up at 7 my day seemed more than I prayed for Got dressed up to head out and ride to school on my skateboard New kid in class I sat alone takin notes while the hoodlums were makin jokes at the clothes that my momma paid for Seemed like everyone was a part of some gang invasion Tattoos the initiation parolers I’m on probation Soakin up the vibe as I study for information Cause lately I been deprived of a normal day But today on my way to eat lunch some kid approached me He told me “we should be cool” if only he got to know me Cause on this side of town I would need some protection It’s crazy reckless and dangerous Unless I’m some sort of gangster I’m only safe with the police He said his name was  I dapped him up at the busses I was kinda skept about him at first cause I didn’t trust him The more I got to know him I couldn’t tell what his motives were Hopin that he was sincere somethin told me “let go” But the only thing on my mind was patience Searchin twice for a different life I was tired of waitin Cause me and  had similar views and conversations infused with knowledge Mainly bout school and college that was my truth but regardless He was type cool when I was wit him Introduce him to my family they were rockin wit him My momma told him “Make sure you look out for my son” And before she could finish her sentence he quickly just interjected and said “Don’t you even stress it I got it under control.” It’s been two months since we met it seemed like we’d gotten close Some cat approached me and tried to beef wit me I just froze Then I see  pounded and stompin homie right out his clothes Called me his brother and told me he got me to the fullest Even if that mean bullets bullies gangs AKs and choppas ‘till they kill us That’s the realest shit I ever witnessed A few weeks later my uncle sold me a Honda Civic A ’93 with no license plates and no registration Just thinkin about every place that I’ma go when I finally get it And then he asked me for a ride around the block some distance from where I was parkin And instantly I knew the spot was sketchy my momma would kill me My intuition told me not to I knew it was wild And plus I knew I had no business or place on that side of town And I read about some chick that went lurkin without a sound and got murked Her body found in that dirt with a thousand rounds It was worse than abandoned buildins of bandits villians and scammers Killers provokin gangsters but maybe I’m overthinkin Maybe I might be straight just as long as I pump the brakes And try not to think about it just trust I’ll be fuckin safe And then I told him “Let’s go hop in.” He dapped me up he started tellin jokes the whole ride there Had me crackin up As we were gettin closer I felt funny my stomach turned Then he told me “Go left make another turn go right and drive slow” As I look it was all abandoned and quiet not a single person in sight nobody standin And right when I pulled the car to the side He said “Right here sit still. Turn the car off and chill.” That’s when I start to panic he told me “Relax.” Then he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed Then my life flashed in an instant He inched to my driver door then I tried to lock it I couldn’t Ripped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then Pulled out the shotty and all I heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces I’m thinkin I must be dreamin’ another shot to my chest And my stomach’s squeezin my breath or my lungs collapsin I’m down on my fuckin knees askin him “Why” He looked at me I looked him dead in the eyes And he smashed my face with the barrel And I throw my teeth to the sky and then uh I heard a  sound of the shotty cock back He pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back I’m still conscious I’m breathin I’m still movin no clue as to why I’m not dead All this blood that I’m losin and I heard my car drive off And I looked up and saw the sun and that was all that I saw Then I heard my conscience tell me “Get up nigga get up You’re losin blood oh my Don’t fall asleep or you’ll die Stay awake and move as much as possible there’s no time Find some help or try to yell you ain’t too well oh God Wake up nigga Wake up Wake up nigga Wake up…” You might also like Woke up at 7 my day was worse than I prayed for Got dressed then head out down the stairs from the eighth floor New kid in class he sat alone takin notes while my niggas were makin jokes At the clothes that his mama paid for Had no family but was cool with the local gangstas Tattoos and now I’m on parole and probation for breakin rules That life was all I knew all I wanted was to do was cruise Smoke weed and say “Fuck school” Wanted guidance cause all my role models I would look up to Was indicted a young dude with no logic I went to church till the pastor said “Fuck you.” Now I’m violent and this gang that always looked out for me Vouched for me and adopted me said they wanted to rock wit me And I wanted to get down guess there was somethin missin Everything comes with a price “There’s only one condition All you gotta do for initiation is kill an innocent victim and leave em there with no witnesses or no snitches If you do that you’d be down with the clique and that’s for life so don’t you ever think you getting outta this shit I thought about it Soakin up the vibe as I study for information tryna choose my victim plottin the weakest prey But today on my way to eat lunch I approached him And told him we should be cool if only I got to know him Cause on this side of town he would need some protection It’s crazy reckless or If only unless he some sort of gangster and he only safe with the police He said his name was  and I dapped him up at the busses Was kind of skeptic about me at first cause he didn’t trust me Then the more he got to know me he couldn’t tell what my motives were Hopin’ that I was sincere but little did he know I was tryna snake him and pop a brick Just need the perfect opportunity I’m tired of waitin’ A murder runnin’ through my head I knew that death was comin’ He introduced me to his family I was jealous of him His momma told me “Make sure you look out for my son“ And before she could finish her sentence I quickly just interjected and said “Don’t you even stress it. I got him to the fullest even if that means bullets bullies gangs AKs and choppas till they kill us.” I was lyin to the fuckin’ limits Took advantage when he said he had that Honda Civic A ’93 with no license plates and no registration Just thinkin’ about every place I’ma go when I finally kill him And then I asked him for a ride around the block some distance from where he was parked And instantly I knew my chance was comin’ I’m ready to drill him Then he told me “Let’s go hop in.” I dapped him up and started tellin jokes the whole ride there Had him crackin up As we were gettin’ closer he felt funny I think he knew somethin’ was comin’ that look he had was enough to tell me But fuck it go right and drive slow As he looked it was all abandoned and quiet Not a single person in sight and nobody standin And right when he pulled the car to the side I said “Right here sit still. Turn the car off and chill.” Then he start to panic I told him “Relax.” Then I pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out laughed His life flash in an instant I inched to his driver door then he tried to lock it he couldn’t And I ripped him right out his seat then I grabbed the side of my jeans and then I pull out the shotty I cocked it twice ‘till he screamed And I shot his arm into pieces I’m watchin’ his blood leakin’ And another shot to his chest seen his stomach squeezing His breath and his lungs collapse and he down to his fuckin’ knees Askin’ me “Why” He looked at me I looked him dead in the eyes Then I smashed his face with the barrel and I throw his teeth to the sky And then  sound of the shotty cock back I pressed it hard against his head and blew his fuckin’ top back24Embed]']\n",

loved at all If that was true I wouldnt be drinking this alcohol Every relationship failed to take a toll on you Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you Is it easier to erase my memories At a point when most of my past women became my enemies Some on the fence some befriended me But when we see each other its gon be some weird energy Im sorry that we couldnt make it work Believe in your heart I never intended to make you hurt Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl Friends talking bout thats supposed to be you girl  I need some real good lovin Cause Im troubled by the things

Its nothin worse than feelin alone But Ill admit to feelin better when Im hearing this song it goes  I need some real good lovin Cause Im troubled by the things that I see I need some real good lovin Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me  So I dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat baby Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed On an empty bed Dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed While I lose my mind So you know

can go Cause the streets are my stage and terrors my show Psychoanalyze tried diagnosin me why It wasnt your brother that brutally died But it was mine so let me define My territory; dont cross the line Dont try to act crazy cause that shit dont faze me If you ran like a punk it wouldnt amaze me Cause my colors death Though we all want peace But our war wont end Till all wars cease  See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man But I dont wanna be down with this situation man But Im in here if I had something better to do I think Id do it But right now Im just down here boy Im trying to get money cause Im smart Im gonna get paid while Im out here Im gonna get that paper ya know what Im saying If I had a chance like you Maybe I would be in school But Im not Im out here

little dice till my knees got sore Kicked around some stories bout the night before Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill She started acting silly simply would not quit Called us all punk pussies said we all werent shit As we walked over to her ho continued to speak So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street But just living in the

his safe kicked me down with cold cash Knew I would get busy he didnt waste time to ask Word  I bought a Benz with the money the rest went on clothes Went to the strip started pimping the hoes My hair

But whenever I fucked up my reup In a dice game I go see her Shell give me enough to buy a quarter ounce And then blow a blunt of that reefer She used to buy a nigga new sneakers Pay the bill on my beeper Just so she can page to put a 69 And I know it time to go freak her Then one day I just asked her Why you always give your ass up I mean damn these hoes get paid All you do is get laid—this shit dont add up. She said Tip all I wanna do is feel love Even if I know it aint real love Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it And then never call back I still fuck. And thats fucked up but she so trill I need somethin she go steal When the trap hot and police ride Nigga guess where we go chill For bout four years she held dope And my four pounds til it go down I

she never gave any nigga time of day But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to But when it came to me she had a thing for me When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me And wed both cut class post up in the cut steady Watchin just to see if the police comin We got close over time her and I Right around the time that I first got signed Come to think about it I was bout 17 I aint even have a license couldnt even drive I was goin back and forth with each flight Another show after show each night She became so suspicious of these other bitches Shed go through my phone and wed fight Talk about torn between the two Wasnt really much more that we could do Wasnt really much space for us But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do But I guess one night I had a few Huh one night I had a few Yeah this little chick that caught my eye I told her Hurry up meet me at the room And no I didnt have a contraceptive What my common sense neglected And two months later next thing I know I got a text that said Im pregnant And you can almost bet she kept it And thats the reason why you left me On top of all that it wasnt even mine I went and got paternity tested—damn When the lights go out And Im in my bed I think of all the madness in my head All of the things that I did back then When Im in my bed I think of all the memories Ive had All of the things I did back then Wait hol up is that you With them big ol thighs after school Jay 305 had gave me high five When I said I’m in hot pursuit You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive A new Monte Carlo that cruise And that shot my pride I tried to improv But no freestyle I never do You lookin for the nigga with the tallest fetti You overlookin every nigga that ain’t quite ready To make it rain on you like Im about to break a levee Hol up that pussy petty Yeah your nails did your hair did Your cell phone is selfish It only got numbers that come with a Hummer Her new prima donna I smelt it Tried to make you mine ho Tried to make some time ho But I ain’t got the time or the patience To stop and wait in line ho Her dreams holds Versace She fall for Armani Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney I’m grown now I’m on my own now I’m pooooppin Change my phone now when I get home now I got ooooptions Fast forward wait is that you With them big ol thighs after school And your three kids and three baby daddies Same car note that’s overdue I know When the lights go out And Im in my bed I think of all the madness in my head All of the things that I did back then When Im in my bed I think of all the memories Ive had All of the things I did back then143Embed 96 ContributorsNo Mediocre Lyrics All I fuck bad bitches I dont want no mediocre ho Dont want no mediocre I dont want no mediocre no Bad

When I be sitting in my room all alone staring at the wall Fantasies they go through my mind and Ive come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen. Ill be waiting I love you12Embed 45 ContributorsAround the Way Girl Lyrics You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving On your loving  I want a girl with extensions in her hair Bamboo earrings at least two pair A Fendi bag and a bad attitude Thats all I need to get me in a good mood She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang I love it when a woman aint scared to do her thing Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop She likes to dance to the rap jam Shes sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams

if I didnt tell you then another brother would Youre sweet like sugar with your gangster talk Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk With your rayon silk or maybe even denim It really doesnt matter as long as youre in em You can break hearts and manipulate minds Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind You always know what to say and do Cold flip when you think your man is playing you Not cheap or petty youre ready for loving Youre real independent so your parents be bugging But if you ever need a place to stay On your loving Come around my way You might also like I

about the brothers who already died And I took so many drugs now my brain is fried When I walk through the streets God is my guide I always try to run but I just cant hide Wont talk to the preacher

gets deeper than that Im lookin for where the Grim Reaper is at I knocked on his door he said come on in And by the way you shoulda brought a friend I said no its me myself and I And not too many people want to die Im sittin in my living room talkin to Death Tryin to figure out what I got left   1/2  Aiyyo man you see that gun over there man You need to pick it up and use it on yourself Nahh nahh I aint aint gon do that Well then you should take it outside and Yknow you got a bullet with everybodys name on it Ahh let me think about it man let me just take a walk ah Yo who dat comin When I left the Grim Reaper I ran into Christ He said DMC you could walk on ice Remember those times that you never fell God was holdin you up man couldnt you tell I kept you cock diesel just like LL Strong with a Message like Melle Mel When things was bad you was doin fine You did a good job of not losin your mind You even read the bible like a hundred times The meaning of life is not hard to find Take

So watch what you say and where you step more carefully If I fall in the field and aint no more air for me Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me Tell my enemies fuck em they know already but fuck em Tell em again with a middle finger and a chuckle You dont know nann nigga nope uh uh This famous thatll still throw copper Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle Fire the ganja back

it locked We gon have it locked We gon have it locked See Rick Ross LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also like Im part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company Its funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they aint want nothing from me My futures so bright but my past so ugly And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me So I accept what got me here reflecting in this rocking chair All this space created all that hard work it got me here So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldnt be here Power to the people so the people shouldnt live in fear And Ill be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air Secluded in my thoughts in fear No one to talk to no one there Not even a voice not even an ear No one alive no one to care Now I got a power circle now Im on a power trip And they calling me counterfeit cause I aint gave a coward shit Stone me throw me a pile of shit but you wont pull me out of it Its funny how it comes full circle Now they wanna be a part of the power circle They wanna be a part of the power circle May the wind be at your back May the bad be in your past May the kids take all your good And your wife have class And you realize your goals And whats life without grind Those niggas yo niggas Hope those niggas real as mine May the wind be at your back May the bad be in your past May the kids take all your good And your wife have class And you realize your goals And whats life without grind Those niggas yo niggas Hope those niggas real as mine  Theres a difference between underrated and hasnt made it Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred Theres no applause for ya and success is hard for ya Theres enemies envy with green my niggas  lawnmower And Im on tour Jordan 4s Tom Ford And I aint thugging they clapping at me a encore Got a dark heart bright mind make women crazy I give her D I throw up two I call that shit a safety Shit is crazy when entertainment aint entertaining And my inner sanctum need real estate Im out my cabeza Jealousys for the weak you aint happy I made it I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers So shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians My circle small but regardless my circumference official My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage They gon blitz us but aint no way that they gon hit us Im so elusive so my niggas be goin through it Guess its a wrap when your codefendant make soul music Cash rule the world  at least it do with girls At least it do with churches seek the truth and true it hurts If they real then they real  my niggas deserve it And we dont deal with weak squares in this power circle We dont deal with weak squares in this power circle Im like welcome to the power circle I came a long way I started with a powdered circle Clique full of real niggas thatll probably murk you Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal Lotta talking lotta Tweeting til you hear that chopper speaking Kill my dog I kill your dog we tied even Id believe it If you see it then you got it nigga never give up Cause if you grindin you gon be rich before you can look up My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up Cause you can sell em hard for the low and give em the hookup And still make the profit The streets say Im the hottest and a nigga still modest Im just being honest Back to the wall never let em get behind us Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers Look at my persona I dreamed it woke up and conquered And there was commas after commas I eat em like Benihanas Put the shrimp over the pasta the pasta over the lobster And the lobster over the table power circle a mafia Just talkin money talkin money what you talkin bout Probably talkin bout us we the only thing to talk about Cause we the only thing to talk about Cause we the only thing to talk about  Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived You wont last a weekend outside Seen a pastor tweaking then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried See a demon dont compromise And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone Im a diamond inside the rough thats too mighty for maricons I might as well put all my killers in YSL Put my voice on this microphone put you pussy niggas through hell Hells fire I never lie you will never grind I know the priors they running by us when we do crime I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July Oh Lord this cant be life no it cant be life When they day breaks and you earned them stripes And you learned that strike From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life Its good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied The death rate will eventually climb so eventually Im On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns So about face if it aint business I get offended I mind Now one fake Im a realist in strive Im a billion in five Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine And I recognize my nemesis gon try to put a finish in my shine But pussy well hurt you Life in the power circle  Regardless of how it goes down Life goes on am I right Tried to warn you niggas I tried to warn you niggas Its too late now Double MG Too much cake Too much power Too much respect Bow down nigga Ugh27Embed 141 ContributorsIdols Become Rivals Lyrics Yo this Chris Rock Im in here with my man

Man I know we had a lot of tragedies lately I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah Rest in peace to Left Eye Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay And everybody lost in the Twin Towers And everybody lost period All we got is hope  I wish the way I was living could stop serving rocks Knowing the cops is hot when Im on the block And I Wish my brother woulda made bail So I wont have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail And I Wish that my grandmother wasnt sick Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick And I I wish Wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother And I Wish I could go deep in a zone And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song And I I wish Wish I could teach us all to fly Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high And I Wish God never gave the men power To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers And I I wish Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers But uh We will never break though they devastate we shall motivate And we gotta pray all we got is faith Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day The Lord is gonna help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today Sit at the light so long And then we gotta move straight forward cuz we fight so strong So when right go wrong Just say a little prayer get ya money man life goes on Lets hope You might also like Cause Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today Take this music and use it Let it take you away And be hopeful hopeful and hell

world to sing Watch the music and have em trippin off the joy I bring shiit I wish that we could hold hands Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man And I I wish Wish the families that lack but got love get some stacks Brand new shack and a lack thats on dubs And I Wish we could keep achieving wonders See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder you feel me I wish And I

yard without you drivin by honkin your horn Screamin some shit leanin out your windows beepin and shit Or pullin up in my drive like I wont leap in your whip And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live So my address ends up on the Internet again So then I do an interview with Spin tellin them That if someone comes to my crib Ima shove a gun in their ribs And reporters blow it out of proportion Oh now hes pullin guns on his fans just for tryna stand on his porch And Im the bad guy ‘cause I dont answer my door like Hey Hi You guys wants some autographs Okay form a straight

and try to stay clean So hes calling up his homie who done came up Livin lavish now they dealin with the same stuff And had that attitude that who he was was worth land And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man Now its different he done did dirt And realized killin men meant comin up but it still hurt And cant nobody change this Its 1994 and we up against the same shit I

Yeah  Our lifestyles be closecaptioned addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell jail and crack sales Hustlers hardly think of culture Or the repercussions while bustin on backstabbin vultures Sellin my soul for material wishes fast cars and bitches Wishin I live my life a legend immortalized in pictures Why shed tears Save your sympathy My childhood years were spent buryin my peers in the cemetery Heres a message to the newborns waitin to breathe If you believe then you can achieve just look at me Against all odds though life is hard we carry on Livin in the projects broke with no lights on To all the seeds that follow me protect your essence Born with less

me And the next generation  Now as I open up my story with the blaze of your blunts And you can picture thoughts slowly up on phrases I wrote And I can walk you through the days that I done I often wish that I could save everyone but Im a dreamer Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game Overlookin his tomorrows and they finally came Look back on childhood memories and Im still feelin the pain Turnin circles in my 9th grade dealin cocaine Too many hassles in my local life survivin the strain And a man without a focus life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin it change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin wealthy and makin it big Over football chose to cook raw wouldnt take but I did And after all my mommas thankin God for blessin the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile Oh wont you smile for me Smile for me now Oh wont you smile for me Oh wont you smile for me Oh wont you smile for me  Fuck the world as we unloading witness furious speeds Unanswered questions keep us all stressin curious Gs Backstabbed and bleedin Crooked thoughts laced with weed learnin Duckin stray shots bullets be hot they burnin Inhale the sherm smoke visualize the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain Strange whispers cowards conversate so quick to diss us Takin pictures for the feds in desperate hopes theyd get us Hit us all give us plenty centuries Forgive my sins since I entered many penitentiaries The best revenge is Fuck friends – we military minded soldiers Bustin shots blindly tryin to find Jehovah To help me somebody save me lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin I aint cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now picture my pain Embrace my words make the world change

shopping Buying gifts for some guy that she dating still jocking Second anniversary and Im congratulating that But man she had an ass so fat You couldnt palm it with Shaquille hands It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants Walked behind her whispering love songs she started smiling So I handed her this bathing suit and told her Try it Replied Why with light brown eyes Im shopping for a

shit I wanted I was being honest even made a promise Not with anybody else this was inner conscience Talking to my fucking self thats a little bonkers I know I still got a lot of shit to conquer I hope that aint even my concern though You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those This aint even bout some shit up on a checklist This about the fact that I’m about to test this I’m about to figure out what my best is I cant avoid it because now your boy invested And I aint gotta a choice except to smile and accept it Pretty reckless pretty restless cause I’ve lived my life expecting love To come the second my attempt was done and yeah I guess to some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz But now I’m bout to be ubiquitous look it up Yeah or that’s at least what I’m assuming But as alluded to reality is looming And now your dude about to make a move and take the truth And hope to God that when he through That what he thought about is proven But honestly Im not afraid that it’s delusion I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion But obviously I been finding this confusin This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing Don’t get me wrong I was born to be big But I always figured it would be the comedy thing So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings What big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me And as the time passed I rhymed faster lines crafted Was high class as I mastered my craft and Goddamn who’d have thought itd get like this Back in 2010 music wouldn’t make that list I’m talking top fivetoten strengths with no winks I would not lie my pen draw with no ink or That’s at least what I thought Til I clawed and scratched the pen til I saw a line draw Then I couldve let bygones be bygones But I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn Like where the fuck is my peak at Not Brown but I make it pop then I beat that Not crowned yet but I don’t think I decreed that Not loud but you know I’m ready to tweet that I just really hope I’m ready to be that Now you seein where D’s at Cause even though I’m softer than a tissue I aint nothing to sneeze at I’m smarter where the fuck your degrees at And I aint harder but I’m hotter homie Where the fuck your degrees at I’m bout to come in and desaturate the chic rap today And evaporate the feedback I hate I elaborate At a later date But I’m getting off the point with the player hate What the fuck was I saying You might also like Ah yeah I’m kind of a slave To my ambition I aint quittin till my shit is appraised

for the day But I’m concerned about the burnin out from uppin the stakes I’m always uppin the stakes I’m taking dinner meetings in New York always up for the steaks We exploring the discussion of great They assuring me that when I’m more elite I’ll be secure and amazed But this isn’t insecurity man Like this the opposite of that confidence in fact My biggest problem is I cant honestly relax Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts And I made a promise that I cant be the body that’s stoppin it Think I need a lobotomy Lil Dicky the prophecy Little bit of anomaly not a commodity Not a façade or a lotta the comedy prodigies Commonly brought up wit Dicky  Feelin weird let me think of an analogy Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality Was people that conform to the ruralest localities To Russell though it was nothin but normality And he really nice up on the plow in actuality Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality And so the mutuality was somewhat rationality So then your man made a plan of practicality Not even a plan it was more of a formality Get a little land and attend to its vitality Then raise a little fam til it all became finality The strategy was just to stay in the course And do your chores when youre happy you aint need to abort Never explored nothing less he rollin round on his horse Then one day he was up on his horse That’s when he went past the porch The path he normally passes forth was fast and short Was after more went faster North Amassed allure to master more And then discovered the court He like Ya Let me down Tim Hopped off lookin puzzled at the round rim Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin sound friction Up in a swish make and he was confounded Because he knew that he had found him But right now; it was still for the fun Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done Then the walking turned to running And the hoppin turned to jumping and dunkin And Russell had to keep coming Because the young’n was fuckin disgustin and lovin it Running it all of a sudden the public Started to come in abundance and fuck with him Cause he was butter and hungry hung jury Cause stories of glory not normally for people like him Then the word got around up to ESPN And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym Bunch a grown men lookin to belittle the kid Because to those men ball was the reason to live And the G.O.A.T.s they been all in since they was kids So this goatowning mofucka look like a dick And even though Russell knows that he doesn’t submit He just chills with a grin And then the game start and this mothafucka take charge Make it rain hard D up on these bitches making children of men Lookin better than his predecessors ever could get Turned the animosity to respect And then the Thunder called him Said they heard a lot about the ballin Told him that they wanna get involved and Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league it’s so appalling Oklahoma City in the autumn hella pretty Awesome errbody laud him Errybitty lookin like they really fucking fallin Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawlin And this mothafucka on the court straight ballin Cash all up in that ass lol’ing at the past like Where the fuck would I be at up on the other path right If I never stumbled pon the game then think of that life Shit who taking care

lame swag is all polished and clean While your favorite rappers like Yeah he got it from me You been brainwashed by a fake life that youre used to livin When I say the word fun what do you envision Prolly drinkin and smokin out with your crew and chillin With clueless women you tryin to bang bumpin New Edition Is that all you think life really is Well if so then youre a fuckin idiot I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it Matter of fact you dont even deserve a brain — give me it Do you even have any goals Aside from baggin these hoes and packin a bowl Well let me guess — no Youre only in school because your parents make you go When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros Yo societys got you livin for a wack cause Youre a fuckin adult with no skills at all You dont read any books or play ball You dont draw — you literally do nothing at all Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits You dont have cause you idolize rappers that do And all they say is I got money and its stacked to the roof And now you think that its gon magically just happen to you How Your lazy ass dont commit to labor You pick somethin up try it out and put it down two minutes later Then you complain about your life cause it aint gettin catered Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshits a hater You wanna succeed you have to try; or one day youll get older And regret it all cause you cant provide Your friends are lowlives dont act surprised Look just cut the bad fruit off of the tree make the sacrifice You might also like Girls stop actin like you want a guy With traits like Romeo — bitch thats a fuckin lie You always talk about how every mans fake and you cant take it And you want somethin real — shut up tramp save it Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn

pregnant and you cant raise it But you caused it your actions made a fat statement You want Romeo then act patient And stop frontin like he in the club posted in the back waitin Its the club where guys put on a new persona After they get loaded with a few Coronas They always shoutin and wild out With habits that very few condone of Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone

need to know what it means cause Im fuckin confused Are you one for always bustin your tool With nothin to lose and somethin to prove To homies up in your crew Is it because youre sellin drugs to get loot And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed Like its fun to be you But your lifes a struggle right and you just hustlin through Nah you hamsterass nigga you just stuck in a loop Man why do black people gotta be the only ones who cant evolve Cause you in the streets actin like a neanderthal Its clear you cant stand the law Youre lost as an abandoned dog And all youre interested in is

streets thuggin And starting shit with anybody meanmuggin Look at you a real nigga thinkin your lifes cool Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through Then they regret it because it wasnt the right move Your real nigga talk seems bogus A real nigga dont brag about being real as long as he knows it And his future doesnt seem hopeless A real nigga stays out of jail handles shit and he keeps focused To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums See this is what happens when raps overcrowded with bums Hope the hour is long when Im rollin out with your tongue The man above is my guide you know the power is strong All you menacin freaks are only in it for cheese And the masscontrol limit was breached — fuck hiphop They only in it for cheese and any eyewitness can see They purposely makin the innocent

power  Yo fuck anybody I might alarm Life is a tour I sit and ride along Takin some notes and then I write the songs I’m starin down the road my life has gone Is this where I belong Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong My mental state is fuckin me up and I cried a pond While asking you for some answers but we don’t have that type of bond That my desires gone with the way that I’ve been livin lately If I died right now you’d turn the fire on Sick of this bullshit niggas call me a sellout Cause I hopped to Christianity so strongly then I fell out Now I’m avoidin questions like a scared dog with his tail down Feelin so damn humiliated cause they lookin at me like I’m hellbound What story should I tell now I’ll just expose the truth Im so close to the fuckin edge I should be close to you But who the fuck are you You never showed the proof And I’m only fuckin human yo what am I sposed to do There’s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions Beggin all fuckin men and women to listen I can’t even beat my dick without gettin convicted These ain’t wicked decisions I got different intentions Ive been itchin to get it I’ve been given assistance But the whole fuckin system is twisted Now I’m dealin with this backlash because Marcus isnt a Christian And I’ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction But I can’t buy it it’s just too hard to stand beside it I need an answer humans can’t provide it I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it It’s truly mindblowin I can’t deny it Is Heaven real Is it fake Is it really how I fantasize it Where’s the Holy Ghost at How long’s it take a man to find it My mind’s a nonstop tape playin and I can’t rewind it You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it I’m frustrated and you provoked it I’m not readin that motherfuckin book because a human wrote it I have a fuckin brain you should know it You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment It was a mission that I had to abort Cause humans be lyin were such an inaccurate source It’s gon’ be hard to put me back on the course Next Jehovah’s Witness to come on my porch I swear I’m slammin’ the door A lot of folks believe it though but I’m not surprised Humans are fuckin dumb still thinkin that Pac’s alive I ain’t tryna take your legacy and torch it down I’m just sayin I ain’t heard shit from the horse’s mouth Just sheep always tellin stories of older guys Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized Now I’m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise Sounds like a fuckin Poltergeist Show yourself and then boom its done Every rumor’s gone I no longer doubt this shit you’re the One I’ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge I’ll donate to a charity that could use the funds Fuck the club; instead of bitches I’d hang with a group of nuns And everyone I ran into would know what I came to do I wouldnt take a step unless it was in the name of you I hate the fact that I have to believe You haven’t been chattin with me like you did Adam and Eve And I ain’t seen no fuckin talkin snake unravel from trees With an apple to eat that shit never happens to me I don’t know if you do or don’t exist its drivin me crazy Send your condolences this is me reachin to you so don’t forget If Hell is truly a pit of fire and I get thrown in it I’ma prolly regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit My gut feelin says it’s all fake I hate to say it but fuck it shit I done lost faith This isn’t a small phase my perspective’s all changed My thoughts just keep pickin shit apart all day And in my mind I make perfect sense If you aren’t real then all my prayers aren’t worth a cent That would mean that I can just make up what my purpose is And I could sit in church and just say “fuck” in the services Man what if Jesus was a facade Then that would mean the government’s God I feel like they’ve been brainwashin us with a lot So much that we don’t even notice that we’re stuck in a box Man everything is “what if” — why is it always “what if” Planet Earth “what if” the Universe “what if” My sacrifice “what if” my afterlife “what if” Every fuckin thing that deals with you is fuckin suspect I’m fuckin done I’m fuckin done This is my fuckin life And I’m livin it I’m havin fun If you really care for me Prove that I need to live carefully But I’ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside For an afterlife that isn’t even guaranteed We are you and you’re us Stop playin games My life’s all I got And Heaven is all in my brain And when I feel Im in Hell My ideas are what get me through pain Do as you please and I’ll just do me I’m a human I’ll stay in my lane; Ill mind You might also like

time for your bullshit  Change is one of the most difficult things that we face. But change is inevitable One reason we dont like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends our job the place we live. And even if its not perfect we accept it because its familiar. And what happens is because were not willing to change we get stuck in what God used to do instead of moving forward into what God is about to do Just because Gods blessed you where you are doesnt mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If youre going to be successful you have to be willing to change Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Whos speaking into your life Who are you depending on Make sure theyre not dragging you down limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever If you dont get rid of the wrong friends you will never meet the right friends71Embed 110 ContributorsIll Mind of Hopsin 4 Lyrics  Check it I used

first time you overdosed A fuckin overload on meth Paramedics saved your ass you was close to ghost You never did know which road to go It’s like you rode the boat And sailed away and hoped to hit the golden coast But you sank like the Titanic The incident it left your life damaged And that’s when I panicked You thought you had it locked Well you ain’t on the right planet If youre tryin to live your life right plan it It’s like your mind vanished you don’t even know that I wish that we could go back Cause it’s so sad when I tell jokes and you don’t laugh Like you used to I really hate to stress it But you strange to mess with so I keep my distance Cause you always got this blank expression Like you’re confused and unaware of yo surroundings Emotions have gone and no one’s found it It’s overwhelmin your momma told you that drugs are bad But you aint listen til the fire burned your ass Now you understand  Now you always look like you don’t know me And I’m mad at the world Cause the meth took away my homie Give me back my homie please come home I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block Like we used to Where’d you go I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future But I was wrong You might also like I shouldve stopped you when I had the chance to do so But back then I had felt like that was too bold You started hangin with new folks And made the drug environment yo new home This world is too cold Could I have prevented this Who knows They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do Sayin it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible So you started skippin school Hangin with these wicked dudes Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool And it’s pitiful where the fuck they at now In they mid20s passed out inside of a crack house Back when you met em I had doubts They put you on the bad route and when you needed they help to pick you up they fuckin backed out They fuckin got you I can’t lie but now your brains fried You don’t even act like you’re the same guy Your momma told you that drugs are bad But you ain’t listen til the fire burned your ass Now you understand  Now you always look like you don’t know me And I’m mad at the world Cause the meth took away my homie Give me back my homie please come home I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block Like we used to Where’d you go I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future But I was wrong I ain’t never felt this shit before it gets me sore I reminisce on us playin Nintendo 64 And that Christmas in 97 we got new crispy boards And we was doin ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor Shit changed and it happened quick but I can’t forget That you was the first homie I started rappin with You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it But now I have to sit and feel bad Look at what your actions did Man you were so outgoin and so hysterical Seein you now is just unbearable it’s terrible You shouldve made your choices wisely Fuckin with poison ivy; without your brain please tell me what would your point in life be It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen Really hurt me and the rest of your family With all your bad decisions We always told you that drugs are bad But you aint listen til the fire burned your ass Now you understand Now you always look like you don’t know me And I’m mad at the world Cause the meth took away my homie Give me back my homie please come home I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block Like we used to Where’d you go I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future But I was wrong Excuse me do you need a ride Looks like you’re goin downtown Yes hop in my ride Well hi I’m Chris Dolmeth I’m your best friend Chris Dolmeth I’m all you need Chris Dolmeth If

They feed us these ideas and they would place em in our hearts to sit Its why players are good at gettin chicks Its why Nike is good at sellin kicks Its why Disney is loved by all the kids Why McDonalds owners are super rich Were too blinded to ever see em pitch See when this happens we take our health Wealth lives and just hand em off Thinkin that we did this from organic thoughts I know you seen parents trick kids With candy toys and Santa Claus The same method is used to trap adults But instead of candy its with money religion drugs and alcohol Mention that shit and its gon arouse

feel like we aint cool unless we have a few hoes Makin us feel like we ugly unless we have a new nose I see naturally beautiful women get Botox fake tits Fake lips they so brainwashed and it doesnt make sense Focus on your life and the path you pursuin Cause yall too busy worried bout what Kim Kardashians doin Check it most of this shit that you sheep are watchin on television Is fake as fuck

Okay okay Yeah in that first grade class they came and got me Your moms outside say goodbye now to everybody UHaul was waiting with all of her things at least what she could pack In the time my dads at work and before he came back Way too young to comprehend what was happenin Are we going to grandmas When are we coming back again Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else Just us in middle school I aint understand Who Melissa was and why she wasnt another man Biased and confused they try explain but nobody can Wanted what I thought was normal she had another plan Such is life even if it took time for me to accept it No longer Dad now but a woman with whom she slept with Over the years when a secret was how she kept it I aint get it admittedly I was skeptic I came around happiness I sees what you may have found And thats whats most important I don’t wanna see you breaking down I wanna see you smile I dont wanna see you make a frown If she loves you then thats all anybody needs maybe now By 05 things had gotten worse Moved to the basement deep depressions a rotten curse Hidin in a dark space her mind and her body hurts Becomin more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts So the worse it got I became more and more afraid Until one night I went into that room on the floor she laid I shook her she was blue her skin was cold and she wasnt breathin Screamed Melissa wake up couldnt fathom that she was leavin Mom and Bro was runnin down I screamed Somebody help Try pumping her chest CPR but it didn’t help Toughest pill to swallow but we lost that’s forced reflection While in her life you made her happy thank you for the blessin Even if I dont stay Even if I dont stay Everything will be okay It’ll

      "['[149 ContributorsChildren’s Story Lyrics Now heres a little something that needs to be heard  Uncle Ricky could you read us a bedtime story Please huh please All right you kids get to bed Ill get the storybook Yall tucked in Yeah Here we go  Once upon a time not long ago When people wore pajamas and lived life slow When laws were stern and justice stood And people were behavin like they ought to good There lived a little boy who was misled By another little boy and this is what he said Me and you tonight were gonna make some cash Robbin old folks and makin the dash They did the job money came with ease But one couldnt stop its like he had a disease He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover The cop grabbed his arm he started acting erratic He said Keep still boy no need for static Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap But little did he know the little boy was strapped The kid pulled out a gun he said Whyd you hit me The barrel was set straight for the cops kidney The cop got scared the kid he starts to figure Ill do years if I pull this trigger So he cold dashed and ran around the block Cop radios in to another lady cop He ran by a tree there he saw this sister Shot for the head he shot back but he missed her Looked round good and from expectations So he decided hed head for the subway stations But she was coming and he made a left He was runnin top speed til he was outta breath Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him Sorry Then he made his move to an abandoned building Ran up the stairs up to the top floor Opened up the door there guess who he saw Who Dave the dope fiend shootin dope Who dont know the meaning of water nor soap He said I need bullets hurry up run The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun He went outside but there was cops all over Then he dipped into a car a stolen Nova Raced up the block doing eightythree Crashed into a tree near university Escaped alive though the car was battered Ratatattatted and all the cops scattered Ran out of bullets and he still had static Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic Pointed at her head he said the gun was full of lead He told the cops Back off or honey here is dead Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong So he let the lady go and he starts to run on Uhhuh Sirens sounded he seemed astounded And before long the little boy got surrounded He dropped his gun so went the glory And this is the way I have to end this story He was only seventeen in a madmans dream The cops shot the kid I still hear him scream This aint funny so dont you dare laugh Uhhuh Just another case about the wrong path Uhhuh Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast Good night You might also like Knock him out the box Rick Knock him out Rick  Oh boy that Uncle Ricky is really weird  I know right what does he mean “Straight and narrow or yo’ soul gets cast  I don’t know I think he be crackin it up or something

deep on the block And you got me locked down in this cold cold world  It was the night before New Year’s and all through the fuckin projects Not a handgun was silent not even a TEC Outsiders were stuck by enemies who put fear And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight Fuck blue and white They escape before them flash the fuckin lights Gunshots shatter firstfloor window panes Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game Whether procalisthenic any style you set it Beat niggas toothless physically cut up like gooses But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses Therefore your fiftytwo handblocks was useless Linx was snatched off necks left scars on throats Jackets took after bullet rips through coats Against those who felt the cold from the steel Made ‘em fold and squeal once the metal hit the temple of his grill Construction worker who was caught for his bomber No time to swing the hammer that was hangin from his farmers And it’s bugged how some niggas catch slugs And pockets dug from everythin except check stubs And it does sound ill like wars in Brownsville Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where Feds look For fugitives to shoot cops niggas layin on roof tops For his C.R.E.A.M he stashed in a shoebox But he was hot and the strip was filled with young killers You don’t suspect so cops creep like caterpillars

for me to intervene And its up to me to bring back the hope Put feeling in the music that you could quote Not saying that I hate it cause yeah I kinda dig it But what good is a ear if a QTip isnt in it So just stick it in and inform your friend Your boy from the hood is on that shit again Hes upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries To splash on the mass from low to upperclass And when the records spins it sometimes blows a wind A fickleness of friends they sometimes hate again They always bring up Tribe I mean can I survive I mean This is my mans I mean this is my fams And heres

night Last night Im sorry thats fine I just think I need a little me time I just think I need a little free time Little break from the shows and the bus rides yeah Bus rides Last year I had a breakdown Thoughts tellin me Im lost gettin too loud Had to see a therapist then I found out Somethin funny’s goin’ on up in my house Yeah I started thinkin maybe I should move out You know pack my cart take a new route Clean up my yard get the noose out Hang up my heart let it air out Air out I’ve been searchin What does that mean Nate Ive been learning Grabbin my keepsakes leavin’ my burdens Well I brought a few with me Im not perfect Lookin at the view like this concerns me Pickin up the cues right Im quite nervous Hate it when I lose sight life gets blurry And things might hurt me Its prolly gonna be a long journey but hey But hey Its worth it though Cold world out there kids grab your coats Its been a minute I know now Im back to roam Lookin for the antidote to crack the code Pretty vivid; I admit it Im in classic mode Dont need pity given to me but I cant condone Talkin down to me Ima have to crack your nose for crackin jokes Im lookin for the map to hope you seen it You seen it Been makin a whole lot of changes Wrote a song about that you should play it I get scared when I walk on these stages I look at the crowd and see so many faces yeah Thats when I start to get anxious Thats when my thoughts can be dangerous Thats when I put on my makeup and drown in selfhatred Forget what Im sayin and— Whered the beat go Oh aint that somethin Drums came in you aint see that comin Hands on my head cant tell me nothin Got a taste of the fame had to pump my stomach Throw it back up like I dont want it Wipe my face clean off my vomit OCD tryna push my buttons I said dont touch it now yall done it I can be critical never typical Intricate with every syllable Im a criminal Intimate but never political pretty visual Even if you hate it Ill make it feel like youre in it though You call me what you wanna but never call me forgettable Leave you deep in thought I could never swim in the kiddie pool Way that I been thinkin is cinematic its beautiful Man I dont know if Im makin movies or music videos Videos videos videos Yeah the sales can rise Doesnt mean much though when your health declines See weve all got somethin that we trapped inside That we try to suffocate you know hopin it dies Try to hold it underwater but it always survives Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies You dont relate to that Must not be as crazy as I am The point Im makin is the mind is a powerful place And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way Its pretty cool right Yeah but its not always safe Just hang with me thisll only take a moment okay Just think about it for a second if you look at your face Every day when you get up and think youll never be great Youll never be great—not because youre not but the hate Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith woo Ive been developin take a look at the benefits Nothin to meddle with I can never be delicate Am I even relevant That depends how you measure it Take a measurement then bag it up and give me the evidence Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative Im a gentleman depending on if I think youre genuine Pretty elegant but not afraid to tell you to get a grip Proper etiquette I keep it to myself when I celebrate ah Ah Its that time again Better grab your balloons and invite your friends Seatbelts back on yeah strap em in Look at me everybody Im smilin big On a road right now that I cant predict Tell me Tone that down but I cant resist Yall know that sound better raise your fist The search begins Im back so enjoy the

crushed when they said I cant leave First I was drunk then I sobered up quick When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb He got a life sentence plus We just some products of our environment How the fuck they gon blame us You cant fight fire with fire I know but at least we can turn up the flames some Every colored person aint dumb and all whites not racist I be judging by the mind and heart I aint really into faces Fucked up the way that we livin is not getting better you gotta know how to survive Crazy I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside Stare in the mirror whenever you drive Overprotective go crazy for mine You gotta pay attention to the signs Seem like the blind following the blind Thinking bout everything thats going on I boost security

Here It Goes Kenan and Kel Show Theme Song Lyrics Aww here it goes  Everybody out there go run and tell Your homeboys and homegirls its time for Kenan and Kel To keep you laughing in the afternoon So dont touch that dial or leave the room Cause theyre always into something Or fronting and you dont wanna miss it Its double K like two to get greatness Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan And you gotta watch Kenan Cause Kenan be scheming With a plan or a plot To make it to the top But theyre kinda in the middle Cause theyre always gettin caught This aint the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew

drinking and smoking Pretending that youre locin but youre broken let me get you open Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny But whos the dummy Cause now you done lost the hustler A downass brother done been replaced by a buster And though I got love for ya I know I cant trust ya Cause my crew is rolling hummers and your crew is rolling dusters And just because of that you act like you dont like the brother no mo Uh I guess thats just the way it go I aint tryin to preach I believe I can reach But your mind aint prepared Ill see you when you get there  Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there You might also like More temptation than faith I guess we livin for the day I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted Im just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention So you dont get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start Id be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender If everybodys a sinner then everybody can be a winner No matter your rag color deep down we all brothers And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us Ima scuffle and struggle until Im breathless and weak I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something Ill be there when you get there waiting with the sounds bumping  Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there You need to loosen up and live a little And if you got kids let them know how you feelin for your own sake give a little Oh you dont want to hear that you busy tryna stack And keep up with the Joness takin advantage of your own The realest homies that youve been knowing for the longest But some aint missing a good thing until its gone Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us We prefer to keep our eyes shut till its right when theres something involved that we desire So hold your head up high if youre poor and righteous I know times seem strife and problems seem endless But at the times of despair we got to put ourselves together And if you feel youre out of the game then you need to get back in it Cause nothing worse than a quitter You got to face responsibility one day my brother So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side  Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there As we walk down the road of our destiny And the time comes to choose which shall it be The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow We got one voice to give and one life to live Stand up for something or lie down in your game Listen to the song that we sing Its up to you to make it big I guess Ill see you when you see me  Ill see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there Ill see you when you get there If you ever get

people dirty looks She always carried books and thought me and my friends were crooks You always see the bitch in the classes She never wore pants she wore a dress and some glasses Teachers used to brag she was the teachers pet And the niggas used to brag how much they wanna get her wet Straight to her butt because she aint tall But you would say fuck her when you saw the bitch walk Ass hanging out by the pound And thats the reason why niggas wanted to get the panties down She kept to herself in the hallways And never looked at niggas like all day And when the last bell rung she was gone So one day I decided to follow the bitch home Her mother was at work she wouldnt get home til six So it was time for Ren to put the bitch in the mix Cause back in the school that was every niggas dream So now its time to get a closer look behind the scenes Dolemite quote  Now I made it to her house but she wouldnt let me in though So I said fuck it snuck around to the window She came into the room and start to undress Now Im biting on my lips saying Damn this bitch is blessed The doorbell rung it was the nextdoor neighbor And he was axing her could she do him a favor She grabbed the niggas hand and took him in the room And layed her on her back as he fucked her with a broom She said she wanted to cum so then she said She wanted him to eat the pussy so she grabbed his head And he started eating her like a Thanksgiving dinner He made the bitch cum and then he put his dick up in her She scratched up his back with her claws But she was screaming so loud he had to gag her with his drawers And after they finish fucking yo the bitch took a shower To wash off the sweat from the last half hour The bitch pulled out some bud and then she started to smoke Took a swig of Jack Daniels and made a few lines of coke That innocent shit gotta go  because this innocent little girl is a ho Yo behind the scenes You might also likeScratched samples  Now I went back to school the very next day And I

Waiting to see a ho like at a matinee show They thought that I was lying cause we waited one hour And when we started to leave the bitch walked out the shower Ass all naked then she laid in her bed Her bottomlips was hanging and she started fingerbanging Her daddy walked in and started beating her with a belt The bitch was so hot she made the leather start to melt But she was liking it yelling Daddy give it to me harder Then he took off all his clothes and start fucking his daughter My niggas outside didnt believe that they would see some And when her mother got home they turned into a threesome Her mama ate the pussy while her daddy doggy styled it The family prayed together and they also laid together I couldnt take no more cause I was too much of a man So I jumped right through the window with my dick in my hand The dad and the mom kept doing what they was doing Cause now it was even it was two against two But a couple minutes after I was in All my niggas jumped in all ten

and Im bad bitch Somethin thats far above average.

Kid Cudi ImmortalIn an extremely personal ”Immortal” Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud this track saw Cudi handle all duties production included.

Rich Homie Quan Type Of WayOne hit wonder or talented hit maker That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way. The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet  even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem54. Vic Mensa Orange Soda53. Ace Hood Bugatti ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels Banana Clipper51. YG My Nigga50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bapesque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights” Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O Black Hippy Remix” ft. Ab Soul Jay Rock Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler the Creator “Answer”47. Joey Badass “95 Till Infinity”46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down Remix” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Coles album Born Sinner. While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses talking about religion his inner struggle and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh and there’s THAT VIDEO The talkrap slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout and then he made that video and this became undeniably nextlevel. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave Oakland”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album this is a dark entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work Remix” ft. A$AP Rocky French Montana SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s singsongy cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to some jumping around is mandatory. But listen closely and you get Chancelor’s dope bars dense greatsounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On Were Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same standout combines Drizzy’s loud arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty bassheavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song  he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris standout track “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark Odd Future feel Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl Thats up for debate but you cant deny that Shyne and everyone else on the song absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed Love Game was one of the most heavilyanticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegadelevel backandforth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as leftfield as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubinproduced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s cheesy sample included Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”“Started From The Bottom” produced by Mike Zombie was the first single off Drakes Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’ but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you you can be completely alone in a crowded room to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hiphop converge on this mixtape cut with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and reintroducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and singsongy verse; Twista on the other hand is not quite so willing to take a back seat successfuly lacing the track with his trademark doubletime bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hiphop is once again Chicagoan.14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world Jay Zs boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 119 of his new albums leadoff track is not Hov but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation so that we are wellprimed for the rappers entry.And what an entry it is. His daughters name is literally the first word out of his mouth and with good reason. A postfatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame while admitting ultimately that he cant leave it alone. And lest we think hes lost a step his patented wordplay is in full effect with a pun on pigeons that puts todays cokerappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar Joey Badass Yelawolf Danny Brown Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.1 Train is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a lineup without a single weak spitter and they all did their worst to this HitBoy produced banger. Its impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here was it the energized Danny Brown the lovable braggart Action Bronson the wordsmith Joey Bad the harddriving Big K.R.I.T. Someone else I cant decide but I do know this the track is flames12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainments main artists Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things and how other people cant have them before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album it was fair to assume it would result in a genreblending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song which represents the rebellious IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop Kanye crafts an uneasy raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl but also hiphop and its impact on him  giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013 fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back” and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West  Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future Who really cares Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like Well many would actually say “the video” which was an overtly cheesy greenscreened steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to muchloved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a followup to his epic 2000 storysong “Stan” fans were nervous.  After all Stan died at the end right So what’s leftPlenty as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew with the autographed Starter cap now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex the song switches perspective revealing an intense look at Eminem’s selfdoubts and anguish. Just before the end he drops the biggest gem of all his insong tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know but trust us Slim we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing Kendrick is in the midst of consumption  the contrast is phenomenal both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night 4 shots of espresso every morning and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure prealbum release but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song like Kanye originally planned The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God””Six minutes Slim Shady you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapidfire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP sneak disses to some of his old buddies and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day Rap God was released and has now amassed over 4 million page views Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say Rap God proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a babys first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons well skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion while sneaking in TV and car references and even mentioning his late grandmother much like Sean did.However there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pacs offspring and the King of New York causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MCs of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper  by their name a rarity in Hip Hop no sneak disses here. Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank OceanNew Slaves is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people  made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry and even Americas prison system it’s hard to disagree The Chitown native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically  would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first His movement spearheaded with this peoples anthem was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the MatrixJust as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West578Embed 93 ContributorsThe Show Goes On Lyrics LASER Yeah yeah Kane is in the building nigga Yeah  Alright already

raving mad Everyone in the world is mad Its a mad crazy world  I see diamondflooded demons Lamborghini angels Lamborghini angels Lamborghini angels Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord Listen not to what he speaks thats been the cursing of his cause A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores Have no part in his affairs less his pestilence be yours Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores But we must still pray that his color will be cured You might also like I see diamondflooded demons

ceiling and a needle in her brain He looks back into the crowd wipes the blood and then explains How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became From the looseness of her tongue to the pollution of her aims To do nothing is barbaric the solution is humane You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain You torture out the wildness then replace it with the tame Blank slate when she recovers she wont even know her name Perfect wife and perfect lover no resistance no complaints May God bless the scientific cure for the

safe But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins He forgives them in advance says that he will do again My fellow Americans...

the sure shot come on  I met this girl when I was ten years old And what I loved most she had so much soul She was old school when I was just a shorty Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me On the regular not a church girl she was secular Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her But I respected her she hit me in the heart A few New York niggas had did her in the park But she was there for me and I was there for her Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her And just cool out cool out and listen to her Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be ‘Cause we related physically and mentally And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around Slim was fresh joe when she was underground Original pure untampered

She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions She was on that tip about stoppin the violence About my people she was teachin me by not preachin to me But speakin to me in a method that was leisurely So easily I approach She dug my rap thats how we got close But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool Cause around the same time I went away to school And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way She probably get her money in L.A And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul She said that the problack was goin out of style She said Afrocentricity was of the past So she got into R&B hiphouse bass and jazz Now black music is black music and its all good I wasnt salty she was with the Boyz n the Hood Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit Just havin fun not worried about

Breakdown Raah Hip Hop Beat Street The king of the beat You see him rocking that beat from across the street And Huh Huh Beat Street is a lesson too because you cant let the Streets beat you Well a picture can express a thousand words to describe all the beauty of life you give And if the world was yours to do over I know youd paint a better place to live Where the colours would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony And where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see Ha I never knew art til I saw your face and therell never be one to take your place Cause each and every time you touch the spray paint can Michelangelos soul controls your hand Then serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head Crescendo of colours hang in tune Man why oh why dya have to die so soon Ashes to ashes and dust to dust where the good die young its all thy must Cause as life must live death must die and the tear shall fall from the living eye Huh The teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind In love and alone but now youre dead and she still cant get you out of her head Huh More tears fall for all youve done trying to be a good father to your only son But now whos gonna make sure that hes fed put a shirt on his back and a roof overhead Tell me whos gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities in the islands genes When your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing Bums on the sidewalk garbage in the streets abandoned buildings bricks of concrete The ladies on the corner are selling their bodies and everybody wants a part in that party Im hanging out tough rocking late at night running wild in the town of the neon light You either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh You gotta make something outta nothing at all Im sitting in the classroom learning the rules and it says you cant do graffiti in school They cant be wrong in the hallowed hall so my notebook turned into a brick wall The heart of a lion and the courage of three and the mind of a man much wiser than me Youre the soul of the brother who wont come back Who died in my arms on the railroad track Cause Im caught in the rat race looking for my own space Theres gotta be a better place for you and me Theres pie in the sky and an eye for an eye Some people gotta die just to be free You search for justice and what do you find You find just us on the unemployment line You find just us sweating from dawn to dusk Theres no justice theres Huh just us Ha Still life urban masterpiece your trademark was written on trains and walls A million dollar gift only God released and yet you got killed for nothing at all So after this therell be no more hard times no more bad times and no more pain No more chump change none of that bull Just movies museums and the hall of fame So all you Hip Hops get on up and lets take it to the top where we belong Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here Everybody lets sing along now cmon say Ho Ho Say Ho Ho And to let me know Im rocking the microphone everybody say Ramo Ramo Ramo Ramo Raah A newspaper burns in the sand and the headlines say Man destroys Man Extra Extra Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose The rise and fall the last great empire the sound of the whole world caught on fire The ruthless struggle the desperate gamble The game that left the whole world in shambles The cheats the lies the alibis And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies Lost in space and what is it worth huh The president just forgot about Earth Spending multi billions and maybe even trillions The cost of weapons ran into zillions Theres gold in the street and diamonds under feet And the children in Africa dont even eat Flies on their faces theyre living like mice And the houses even make the ghetto look nice Huh The water tastes funny its forever too sunny And they work all month and dont make no money A fight for power a nuclear shower And people shout out in the darkest hour Of sights unseen and voices unheard And finally the bomb gets the last word Christians killed Muslims and Germans killed Jews And everybodys bodies are used and abused Huh Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted Superiority complex is deep rooted Leeches and lices and people got prices Egomaniacs control the selfrighteous Nothing is sacred and nothing is pure So the revelation of death is our cure Hitler and Caesar Custer and Reagan Napoleon Castro Mussolini and Begin Ghengis Khan and the Shah of Iran Mixed with the blood of the weaker man The peoples in terror the leaders made the error And now they cant even look in the mirror Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher And thats the reason why we got to get tougher To learn from the past and work for the future And dont be a slave to no computer Cause the Children of Man inherits the land And the future of the world is in your hands So just throw your hands in the air And wave em like you just dont care And if you believe that youre the future Scream it out and say Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Raah Beat Street Breakdown

performing hey they aint no joke Down with the sound called BDP  Back in the days I knew rap would never die I used to listen to Awesome2 on WHBI I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops Rappers wore bellbottom Lee suits Me and Kenny couldnt afford that So we would go to the park when they was jammin to hear rap I used to listen till the cops broke it up I always thought to myself Damn why they fucked it up But nevertheless I was in love with the microphone And it stayed that way until I left home On the streets of New York now Im free But with freedom comes big responsibility I used to walk around driven by the force I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off I used to wonder about crews that used to rock They were large but none of them could

Around 1984 I left the group home again alone Still dreamin about the microphone Gimme a chance man I know I can rock it But I had to worry about puttin money in my pocket So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock And we both loved hiphop I was takin suckas out in the shelter system Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss em But all along my vision was

these critics had opinions Scott would say Just keep rappin Ill keep spinnin We had a fucked up contract but we signed it And dropped the hiphop album Criminal Minded We told the critics your opinions are bull Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full Hiphop pioneers we didnt ask to be But right then hiphop changed drastically People didnt wanna hear the old rap sound We started samplin beats by James Brown In the middle of doin My Philosophy Scott was killed and that shit got to me But knowin the laws of life and death I knew his breath was one with my breath I had nothin left and it was scary So I dropped By All Means Necessary Another hiphop group that was a friend of me Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back These two albums set off

cook If you dont like what you wearing you get a different look You wanna escape Armageddon read a different book When knowledge is right there we dont even look December 2012 got this whole world shook But look the last days for others are the first days for us The question to ask is who can you trust Respect to all that 2012 stuff But when you really study it its fear it dont apply to us Yo Hollywood lies to us all day The question is what does your culture say Wheres your culture at Whos your prophet What history guides your spiritual logic It starts with a story then its hypnotic Then any myth that comes along you just adopted it Why Because your culture you forgot it December 2012 lets continue this topic Turn the page the present world age Began 3114 BC According to the Mayan calendar this age concludes December 21st 2012 AD This 5125 years cycle of calm is one world age Nothing changes overnight its all a process A transition it happens over many days In the Mayan calculation a Kin is one day The Mayan Winal thats 20 days The Tun is 360 days A Katun is 7200 days The Baktun is 144000 days And they applied that to the Milky Way In the cycles they saw the Sun Moving across the Milky Ways equator Lining up with other galactic neighbors Weve been shifting for 30 years it seems From 1980 to about 2016 The shift is now its occurring now But if youre learning from the movies you wont know how to survive Or stay alive after the storm Cause after that a New World Order is born Oh you dont know man About they programs You still watching Lindsay you dont see

blinded the Aztecs cause he was a thief Look the Yucatan thats a Mayan book of cycles It lets the Mayans know when the Gods are gonna strike you In fact every 13 Katuns you see The Mayans were visited with a catastrophe So every 200 and 56 or 7 years The Mayan people lived with this fear So on the island of Tayasal now Flores The Spanish came armed with this knowledge They knew according to the Mayan heavens That the next cycle was 1697 So as the Mayans stood there fixed on the heavens The Spanish showed up with all of their weapons March 13th 1697 The Mayan people learned a terrible lesson Your fears and tears are used against you Cause 80% of world control is mental But back to the Mayans they getting some more 257 years after Tayasal A USbacked coup overthrows their democracy in 1954 Thats exactly 257 years from when the Spaniards arrived at their shores Im getting to the core of the lesson Lets see what happens in 2211 Thats the next cycle that people remember Like 2012 the 21st

where I see you fallin in the deep end Is it love I would really love to know the meaning Whats the grudge that youre holdin Hold my hand Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin Look at the sun all we need to see to know our freedom Open up your heart If we dont love then we fall apart  This could be forever baby I never seen you wetter baby Than when the tears fall soakin up your sweater baby I didnt mean harm—dont make me regret it baby Cause if I never knew you I could never do this to you Hope you understand They never taught me how to be a man only how to be a shooter I only need the time to prove it Cause this could be forever baby This could be forever baby This could be forever baby This could be forever maybe Do you like the sunshine do you like the snow Do you wanna talk about it or be alone I think that you should know That this could be forever baby  My teachers told me we was slaves My mama told me we was kings I dont know who to listen to I guess we somewhere in between My feelings told me love is real But feelings known to get you killed I feel as if Im misconstrued I spend my moments missing you Im searching for atonement Do I blame my

that Football was cornerback never made a game I played for Compton High But my daddy was the man that would be suicide Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride Always told me that he loved me fuck his foolish pride As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man  Cause my daddy did it eyes bloodshot With the caddy tinted fuck handouts Fuck the county building never seen that Catch him riding round

Ice Cube And EazymotherfuckingE Order order order Ice Cube take the motherfucking stand Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth And nothing but the truth so help your black ass You goddamn right Well wont you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say  Fuck the police comin straight from the underground A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown And not the other color so police think They have the authority to kill a minority Fuck that shit cause I aint the one For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun To be beating on and thrown in jail We can go toetotoe in the middle of a cell Fuckin with me cause Im a teenager With a little bit of gold and a pager Searchin my car lookin for the product Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics Youd rather see me in the pen Than me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benzo Beat a police out of shape And when Im finished bring the yellow tape To tape off the scene of the slaughter Still getting swole off bread and water I dont know if they fags or what Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts And on the other hand without a gun they cant get none But dont let it be a black and a white one Cause theyll slam ya down to the street top Black police showing out for the white cop Ice Cube will swarm On any motherfucker in a blue uniform Just cause Im from the CPT Punk police are afraid of me huh A young nigga on the warpath And when Im finished its gonna be a bloodbath Of cops dying in L.A.xa0 Yo Dre I got something to say You might also like Fuck the police fuck— fuck— Fuck the police fuck— fuck— Fuck the police fuck the— fuck the—

fuck this shit Alright smartass Im taking your black ass to jail MC Ren will you please give your testimony To the jury about this fucked up incident  Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority Because the niggas on the street is a majority A gang is with whoever Im steppin And the motherfuckin weapon is kept in A stash spot for the socalled law Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw Lights start flashing behind me But theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me But that shit dont work I just laugh Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path For police Im saying Fuck you punk Reading my rights and shit its all junk Pulling out a silly club so you stand With a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so you can see whats up And well go at it punk and Ima fuck you up Make you think Ima kick your ass But drop your gat and Rens gonna blast Im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime But Ima smoke em now and not next time Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me Or any asshole that threatens me Im a sniper with a hell of a scope Takin out a cop or two they cant cope with me The motherfuckin villain thats mad With potential to get bad as fuck So Ima turn it around Put in my clip yo and this is the sound *Gunshots* Yeah somethin like that But it all depends on the size of the gat Takin out a police would make my day But a nigga like Ren dont

bullshit Im tired of the motherfuckin jackin Sweating my gang while Im chillin in the shack and Shining the light in my face and for what Maybe its because I kick so much butt I kick ass or maybe cause I blast On a stupid ass nigga when Im playing with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say They put out my picture with silence Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah Im a gangsta but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge what do you got A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot By me or another nigga And with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger Size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool And as you all know Es here to rule Whenever Im rollin keep lookin in the mirror And ears on cue yo so I can hear a Dumb motherfucker with a gun And if Im rollin off the eight hell be the one That I take out and then get away While Im driving off laughing this is what Ill say Fuck the

Thats played out. Hit it  Dont you give me all that jive about things you wrote before Is alive Cause this aint 1823  aint even 1970 Now Im the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know So every year just about this time I celebrate it with a rhyme Gonna shake it gonna bake it gonna make it good Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighborhood Gonna ring it gonna sing it till its understood My rappin bout to happen like a knee youve been slapping Or a toe youve been tapping on a hunk of wood Bout a redsuited dude with a friendly attitude And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block Got a long white beard maybe looks kinda weird And if you ever see him he can give you quite a shock Now people let me tell ya bout last year When the dude came flying over here Well the hawk was out snows on the ground Folks stayed in to party down The beat was thumping on the box and I was dancing in my socks And the drummer played at a solid pace And a taste of the bass was in my face And the guitar player laid down the heavy layer Of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat And the guy with the 88s started to participate And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet You might also likeWe were all in the mood so we had a little food And a joke and a smoke and a little bit of wine When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof Could it be or was it me I was feeling super fine So I went to the attic where I thought heard the static On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop Just a trick St. Nick and I let the sucker in He was rolly he was poly and I said Holy moly You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd On the point of his jaw where the skin shouldve been Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low So the beard may be weird but Ill never have it sheared Cause its warm in the storm when its ten below I said Youre right its cold tonight But can you stop for a drop before you go He said Why not if the musics hot And Ill chance a dance beneath the mistletoe So he went downstairs and forgot his cares And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro And every young girl tried to rock his world But he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go And before he went this fine old gent Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags In the top or the bottom he reached in and got em Toys for the boys for the girls glad rags And the grownups got some presents too A new TV and a stereo A new Seville bout as blue as the sky The best that money couldnt buy Cause money could never ever buy the feeling The one that comes from not concealing The way you you feel about your friends And this is how the story ends The dude in reds back at the Pole Up north where everything is cold But if he were right here tonight Hed say Merry Christmas and to all a good night12Embed 20 ContributorsIf I Ruled The World Lyrics If I ruled the world Id love all the girls Wear diamonds and pearls If I ruled the world  If I ruled the world was king on the throne Id make peace in every culture build the homeless a home Im not running for Congress or the President Im just here to tell the world how my story went You see  first it was a dream I was living in Rome And then I moved to London bought a brand new home And everywhere I went I drew lots of attention Like a stretch limousine one of those new inventions It took a few years fore the day had come But I was ruler of the world ranked #1 So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown Let the whole world know that the King was in town As I arrived the crowd started to cheer And then someone yelled out The King is here So I headed toward stage to make a speech About the new style of living I was gonna teach uhhuh  If I ruled the world huh huh huh huh huh Id love all the girls  Id love em love em baby Wear diamonds and pearls If I ruled the world You

Dinner Party And late that night at my Super Dinner Party I was dancing to the beat and entertaining LaDiDaDi The music started ending it was time for a speech The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd But now I rule the world and I feel so very proud Excuse me please for stopping this show I just had to thank you all huh and me so My first day in office the King on the throne I spent my first three hours on the telephone You know with newsmen reporters and voters too I had so many calls I didnt know what to do You know hours passed I continued to work I signed so many papers my fingers started to hurt Then I shook off the pain say this aint no thing Cause theres nothing in the world like being #1 king  If I ruled the world huh huh huh huh huh Id love all the girls  Id love em love em baby Wear diamonds and pearls oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah If I ruled the world whoa whoa yeahhhhh {AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}  Now I rule the world and now Im on top And Im rolling with folks that could never be stopped And Im here to let you know this is where I belong And to you sucker MCs that sing my song And its a song thats strong about right and wrong And Ima rock it to you baby baby all night long And its a song about love and happiness In a world of peace and you know thats fresh Now Im the king and I want you to know That Im the Master Blaster Rapper whos running the show And to all of you rappers in every country You better stop what youre doing and listen to me Cause we gotta stop war and use unity To fight crime and hunger and poverty Cause the African baby is dying overseas While you sucker mission politicians busting out Zs Huh 20 million people all unemployed While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd While the working class just struggles hard Try to make ends meet against all odds While the poor man cant even deal with life You know he tried to escape and smoked the coke on the pipe And its time for a CHANGE to a better way Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class And take heed to the message or we aint gonna last Cause I know the solution is the contribution Of woman and man to just join the revolution Thatll take your brain to a higher plane And help you deal in a world thats gone insane With the problems that I know we can stop From the ruler of the world and the man on top But the years went by and time was up And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck And all the people at the time who said they were my friends Didnt know me when my job had come to an end The King who took my place was happy as can be He was running his mouth like Muhammad Ali So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door On my way to the ghetto to treat once more If I ruled the world huh huh huh huh huh Id love all the girls  Id love em love em baby Wear diamonds and pearls oh yeah yeah If I ruled the world

youre gonna survive past 110th There aint no thing when blood is spilled But he emergency ward is capacityfilled And nothing ever comes as a big surprise And the naked city never closes its eyes A new

astray He learned about life the real hard way Wearing pretty things for all the ladies to see Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry Spent all his time just counting his bank Because hes a fly muhhaha now fill in the blank Because hes a fresh kid his moneys long Been the subject of a ghetto song Poor kids admire ladies desire They say water cant put out his fire Because hes a fresh kid yeah hes alright He grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night And you could measure or even treasure The thought that cocaine became his pleasure Peruvian rock never cut with speed And he gets skeed until his nose would bleed And there was just one weakness I must admit Is that when he took a hit he could never quit Because hes one slick pusher living day by day When the crazy thing happened along the way You know he started to base at a hell of a pace And now its a disgrace hes got the pipe in his face For twentyfour seven a terrible Jones Didnt take care of business didnt answer the phone He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone Just biting on his pipe like a dog on a bone Turning blue in the face by just holding his breath With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest But then he tried to stop but it never worked And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk Just to break it all down you know hes not so slick Because he spent all his money and he spent it all quick He lost his car his house his friends his wife And basing cocaine made him lose his life Because he bought some on credit and couldnt pay And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away In a blaze of glory in his own territory 8 million sad but all real stories 8 million stories 8 million stories 8 million stories You hear what im saying 8 million stories Homeboys and girlies 8

Three thats the magic number Three Yes it is its the magic number Three Somewhere in this hiphop soul community Was born three Mase Dove and me And thats the magic number What does it all mean  Difficult preachin is Posdnuos pleasure Pleasure in preachin starts in the heart Something that stimulates the music in a measure Measure in the music breaks in three parts Casually see but dont do like the soul Cause seein and doin are actions for monkeys Doin hiphop hustle no rock and roll Unless your names Brewster cause Brewsters a punk Three Parents let go cause theres magic in the air Criticizing rap shows youre out of order Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires And dont get offended while Mase dosidos your daughter A tricamera rolls since our musics now set Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y production It stands for Da Inner Sound Yall and yall can bet That the actions not a trick but sure nough a function What does it all mean You might also like Everybody wants to be a DJ Everybody wants to be an Em Cee But being speakers are the best And you dont have to guess De La Soul posse consists of three And thats the magic number Three  This here piece of the pie Is not dessert but the course that we dine And three out of every darn time The effect is Mmm when a daisy grows in your mind Showing true position this here piece is Kissin the part of the pie thats missin When that negative number fills up the casualty Maybe you can subtract it You can call it your lucky partner Maybe you can call it your adjective But odd as it may be Without my one and two where would there be My three Mase Pos and me And thats the magic number What does it all mean Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds Common are speakers who honor the scroll Scrolls written daily creates a new sound Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom Wisdom of a Speaker a Dove and a Plug Set aside a legal substance to feed em For now get em high off this dialect drug Three Time is a factor so its time that counts Count not the negative actions of one Speakers of soul say its time to shout Three forms the soul to a positive sum Dance to this fix and flex every muscle Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber Advance to the tune but dont do the hustle Shake rattle roll to my magic number Three  Now you may try to subtract it But it just wont go away Three times one What is it One two three And thats a magic number  Yo whats up One two three  I say children what does it all mean  Woahwoahwoah one two three  I wouldnt lie to you  No more no less thats a magic number Three No more no less  What it is No more no less  Is this the future No more no less  Do the shangalang No more no less  Lord tomboy tryna talk to me No more no less  Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car No more no less  How highs the water mama No more no less How highs the water mama No more no less Three feet high and rising No more no less

As you know I’ve been through three passports 76 countries on the regular in the name of HipHop since 1987 and in 2010 although I’ve never stopped traveling the earth this year I’ve seen heard and felt some new things As far as RAP and HIPHOP it’s like USA Olympic basketball the world has parity now and have surpassed the USA in ALL of the basic fundamentals of HIPHOP – TURNTABLISM BREAKING GRAFFITI and now EMCEEING with succinct mission  meaning and skill. Skillwise rappers spitting three languages have created super rappers to move the crowd with intensity and passion. The “arrogant” American comes in blackface but if there was a HIPHOP or Rap Olympics I really don’t think the United States would get Gold Silver or Brass or even ass for that sake Personally Public Enemy has been setting records in a record book that doesn’t really exist. The 20th year anniversary of FEAR OF A BLACK PLANET has become into a year and a half celebration of eights legs and five continents. All the while looking at a HIPHOP Planet across 25 countries while still somewhat supportive of American rap the rest of the world has surpassed the U.S. in skill in fundamentals and commitment to their communities. Public Enemy’s mission is to set the path pave the road for cats to do their thing for a long time as long as they do it right Because of the lack of support from local radio television and community in the United States the ability for “local” acts to thrive in their own radius has killed the ability to connect and grow into a proper development as a performer entertainer and artist. Rappers trying to get put on to a national contract hustle from a NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES corporation has caused the artform to atrophy from the bottom while never getting signed to a top echelon that really doesn’t exist but to a very few HIPHOP NEWS spreads like any other mainstream NEWS in America. The garbage that’s unfit to print has now floated on websites and blogs like sh*t. For example a rapper working in the community gets obscured while if that same rapper robbed a gas station he’d get top coverage and be label a “rapper” while getting his upcoming or current music somewhat put on blast regardless of its quality which of course is subjective like any other art. RAP sites and blogs are mimicking the New York POST This is not mere complaint  this is truth and its coming down on Americans like rain without a raincoat with cats screaming how they ain’t wet. This is real. The other night upon finishing groundbreaking concert performances in Johannesburg we followed a special free concert in Soweto. To make a point that our agenda was to “show and encourage the HipHop community to be comfortable in its mind and skin without chasing valueless Amerikkkan values Never have so many been pimped by so few It does the people of the planet little good to hear that an an artist is famous and rich will wear expensive jewelry straight from the mines show it off stay it the hotel ride in limos do the VIP with chilled champagne in the clubs ape and monkey the chicks meaning not even talking and keep the dudes away with slave paid bodyguards when real people come close. The mimic of the VIACOMsanctioned video has run tired because it shows off does NOT inspire and it says NOTHING Here in South Africa PUBLIC ENEMY has done crucial groundbreaking performances. Its the same level of smashing the house that we’ve done this year in Moscow New York Paris London  Chicago and other places this year. This is not news We are not trying to prove any point other than to show that a classic work is timeless and doesn’t have a demographic per se. The Rolling Stones and U2 are NOT measured by mere tracks’ they are measured by the allaround event they present. The art of the performance has left HipHop whereas somebody has led artists to do more performing off the stage than on it. The agenda here is to create artist exchange This serves as a call to the infrastructureless HipHop game in Amerikkka. We know what your hustle is but what is your work and job here Faking it until making it runs its course in a recession which is a depression for Black folks who increasingly are becoming more skillless as they become jobless Never have so many been pimped by so few Since the music has so much power and image has become everything to the point that it can dictate the direction of a person in their life It is my mission now to really become a “freedom fighter” and stop this radiation. With JayZ and others who for years would faint their worth the statement of “with great power comes great responsibility” is more true. Words are powerful and they can both start wars and bring peace. This cannot be taken lightly. Its important for the words to be body with the community. If not one dime of $250 million doesn’t benefit the people who contribute to it then why does that warrant coverage above the will and effort of many in the music who have done great things You might also likeNever have so many been pimped by so few I turned 50 this year. Everyday I get the question whats up with HipHop today. If nothing was wrong the question wouldn’t be the dominating question I get. I do massive interviews worldwide. I’m covered from varied aspects HipHop Public Enemy social issues musicology in general. So my interactive world dialogue is deeper and more present than 140 characters Never have so many been pimped by so few I am tired of the silence of people that know better. There is nothing worse than a person that knows better and does worse. Or says nothing And makes excuses for bulls**t You know damn well HIPHOP in the USA has fell way the fuck off as the American dollar and much of America itself. Held up and dictated by White business lawyers accountants in New York and Los Angeles offices To dictate to a community and not even live or be with the people is offensive. VIACOMs reach into Africa to turn HIPHOP in to Amerfrica which is as exploitative as those slavemakers who carried us across on boats. The decisions made in a boardroom in New York City while these cats scurry to their high rises and suburban mansions from cultural profiteering must stop. And I’m going to do something about it Never have so many been pimped by so few My agenda of HipHop around the world is in line with its creators who followed Black Music. The music had the people’s back. It has never been my personal agenda. Americans arrogantly have no back. HipHop has followed this. I am disturbed by the fact that I tell artists that doing work in their community will get them little or no buzz for their effort but in the same sense if they robbed or shot someone or did a bid they would get national and sometimes international attention Never have so many been pimped by so few So many of your favorite people suck up to the NBA and NFL because it has order and when you make the game look bad David Stern or Robert Goddell is kicking their asses out . They are the indisputable HWIC and negroes are in line and silenced. But here in HipHop the dysfunctionality reward makes the money that puts food on many tables Its time because I hear too many excuses. I wont allow what’s in the USA f**k up what I and others worked hard to instill. I drive a ’94 Montero a ’97 Acura and have no expensive jewelry. There is nothing on this planet materially that is better than myself. This is what I instill in many doing HipHop that nothing is greater than what is given. These games of people doing anything to get things has seeped into my way so therefore witness some radical virtual things coming from me in protecting the artform of HipHop Never have so many been pimped by so few So I’m going after the few I’m tired of it Chuck D from CaPEtown South Africa Public Enemy’s 71st Tour 6th Leg of a Fear Of A Black Plan Tour1Embed 1 ContributorTear Down That Wall Lyrics Somebodys souls been exposed in this house of blues The real emperor without clothes has much to lose Road weary troubadour Maybe Im an ambassador not to be confused with some spook or bastard by the door Before I got paid by the word now its deferred New Dust Bowl poet you aint heard it now you heard Showed yall I aint tired damn sure aint quiet Plenty of things to teach about Im reaching to the choir Damn my man one at a time This beats fire face told me Brent you be bombing the place The Bob to the Bob the Bob is back weaving bobbing and spilling Like Womack Marley and Dylan Deep songs front page of your life this is you Invasion of your mental vacation and your crew This aint brand new just because yall aint never knew I spit politics on that wall where the people get screwed   Hiphop supporting nonstop sweatshops So you can retail your ass off without fail Then some of you get setback Blame this immigration exploitation with your the lack of information by yelling Wetbacks Somebody acting Forever 21 Cant hide cant cry cant run Blame it on the crack or fight back without a passport Millennium Gestapo border control the new contact sport Yall call them immigrants and take them to court But look at your hood and your lack of support Some of these DJs have no idea what theyre playing Some of these rhymers dont realize what the hell theyre saying So I let them chase the cash honey without a plan Forget Johnny was the man in black but Im the black in man This is modern day slavery and part of the plan With all due respect sir Tear down that wall man You might also like  Understand these pressures in this socalled recession For the Black Brown Woman and Man; its depression Roster of the stricken Bernie made off with the money Now the hidden hand is bitten and now it aint funny I beg your pardon whos saving you Youre calling them laborers Walk on by and never say hi or consider them neighbors Some got the nerve to live in Texas Arizona Cali and not know Even missing the cue in New Mexico Diss the Brown brothers and sisters on what they done did This side of the Earth they built pyramids My passion comes and what I know and who I am I refuse to lose or to be confused by this new scam Scarred by sarcasm Uncle Sams racist orgasm Was just a spasm scared of enthusiasm Of the Black and Brown planet the jealous say Damn it Stupid ass wall you cant stop us all Embed 3 ContributorsEndonesia Lyrics  Yeah feedback back for your bad ass yeah As you witness Im surrounded by two more emcees outta my war council My Rottweiler of Rhymes BWyze a.k.a.

I dont want to take my time going to work I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag and ten or fifteen girls What the hell I wanna go off into – and go to work for Work for what money I got all the money

depths out of controlled by Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes Imminent gaze cast pon the path that winds Pon the path I find and claim as mine To ride the waves of unrest Made to make me shine as

In the bottomless wells of emptiness Channeled to invoke what we represent Secret order elitist horde of creeping fire seizing power Riders of the lupus hour Eye on palm time is gone Moonlight drawn

burning black torch Wisdom of the old and true Possessed by the chosen few Shining to reveal the ways Of a darkness that pervades All that is and ever was Inferno of witches blood Worship is not on

Witching currents through the eye Of storms that force the false to die Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies Beware God is watching Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone In splintered skeleton I roam Wastelands with naught to call my own But the path I walk alone The hunger burns within my gut As my bones turn into dust God is watching God is watching And I know soon

Heated Lyrics Been workin way too much need to get out and get fucked up Whats going on Wheres it at Make some calls to make it crack lets see I need money drugs a ride And a spot with hot ones inside The mission  To get all of the above in a limited amount of time I can do this and its done Like that were on our way Be it acid on the tongue Cocaine in your brain Or some weed that hits your lungs Like a runaway train Hell yeah from DMT to MDMA Got all that shit and more So till dawn were okay but anyway  Fuck a line every time Get in get a drink and lose our minds All eyes on the dime That makes your dick want to grind Know you got a good buzz going Cause everything is glowing Skirt so short her ass is showing And shes looking so you’re knowing You could get it tonight But there’s so much around Best take your time do it right You might also like As you keep getting higher Lights look like theyre on fire Soon all that’s left of you Is your most primal desires Ass clappin dick suckin lock the door to the bathroom – quick fuckin Find a whore and it could happen But its nothin cause youre drunk and youll be blackin out Before you even get a chance to think bout what youre doing  I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take

that has the whole party movin Youre cruisin you dont know what youre doing and you dont give a Cause youre so liquored up you throw it up And keep on riding cause your timing is on And that fine one is on you its time to get gone Too far up in it to yawn till its finished come on Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks Start to pondering rape Me Im all about the face But it takes all kinds So pay no mind to the taste Want to hear that song You know the one with the bass That makes their asses gyrate Forget to hydrate Till theyre so fucked up they take Off all of their clothes and whip It on me like my bodys made to fit tween their lips You got the ones on their grill Or between their hips But either way I must say I really dont give a shit Long as its done well and they promise not to tell We could do this like an orgy In the bowels of hell Where every Lucy’s hella horny And their pussies dont smell Argh... Wheres it at  I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch Bitch bitch bitch bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch  Responsibilitys cool but there’s more things in life Like getting your dick Rode all fucking night By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight Legs in the air looking like they feel nice Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice And the drugs got you going back for more cause youre like I just cant get enough of that cum clutch well alright Its time to find one and take one Right now Its time to find one and make one say Im down Think I just found one bout to break one off Meanwhile  Hallucinating crazy getting lost for miles May have gotten too fucked up cause I forgot how to smile Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style Will it work Probably not but its worth a try  First hot one I see with sex in her eyes Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight Wish me luck give me dap And Ill talk to you later And when I do lets hope my story isn’t all about haters Wheres it at Cause I want it like man Got the drugs but need a hot one thatll make me go damn Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed If you got it push it up on me cause Im feeling that ass know what I mean Wheres it at  I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch bitch bitch bitch I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch Bitch  I want it I need it need it to make me feel heated Shake it cant take it must break it Break if off yeah whatd I say bitch38Embed 63 ContributorsYou Might Think He Loves You for Your Money but I Know What He Really Loves You for It’s Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat Lyrics Get so fuckin dark in here Comecome fuck apart in here I die in the process You die in the process Kettle drum roll hard shit Fuck I said fucker dont start shit  Comecome fuck apart in here I Comecome fuck apart in here I  I hover above you Life pulled out your mouth I become you Opening of the mouth Unlawful possession Jellyfish in cold sweat deep end Hollow shell twitch disconnection Pupils swell My entrance Hijacked no questions asked Stretch you on like latex mask My sigils your epitaph You might also like Comecome fuck apart in here I Comecome fuck apart in here I Die  Im not you Im not you Im not you  Fear You wear it well Mademoiselle Heres to your destiny Hysterics scream help Dont worry in a few youll all be somewhere else Prepare yourselves Freelance motherfucker  Get so fuckin dark in here Comecome fuck apart in here I die in the process You die in the process Kettle drum roll hard shit Fuck I said fucker dont start shit Emerald tablet apartment toxic Comecome fuck apart in here I Comecome fuck apart in here I46Embed]']\n",
